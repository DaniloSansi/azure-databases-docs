# Migrate AdventureWorks
This quickstart migrates the sample AdventureWorks 2014 database from an on-premises SQL Server instance to an Azure SQL database.  It uses Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to migrate the schema and Azure Data Migration Service to migrate the data.

## Prerequisites
- An instance of SQL Server with an AdventureWorks 2014 database that is directly connected to Azure.
- An empty Azure SQL database.
- [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://aka.ms/get-dma)
- Azure DMS requires a VNET created by using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployment model, which provides site-to-site connectivity to your on-premises source servers by using either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways)..

## Create a migration project
1. Open Microsoft Data Migration assistant and choose **+** to create a new project.
1. Set **Project type** to "Migration"
1. Give the project a memorable name
1. Choose "SQL Server" for **Source server type**
1. For **Target server type**, choose "Azure SQL Database"
1. **Migration scope** must be set to "Schema only"

1. Choose the appropriate **authentication type** for your server.  This example uses SQL Authentication, your screen may look slightly different.
1. Enter your **username** and **password**
1. Ensure **Encrypt connection** is checked and if you are using a self-signed certificate also check **Trust server certificate**
1. Click **Connect**

1. Choose AdventureWorks 2014 and click **Next**

> [!NOTE]
> Credentials used to connect to the source SQL Server instance must have CONTROL SERVER permission.

## Select target
1. Enter the name of your Azure SQL server
1. Choose the appropriate **Authentication type** for your server.  This example uses SQL Authentication, your screen may look slightly different.
1. Ensure **Encrypt connection** is checked
1. Click **Connect**
1. Choose your Azure SQL database and then click **Next**
![Select migration target](media/quickstart-sql-server-to-azure-sql/DMASelectTarget.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The principal used to connect to the target Azure SQL database must have CONTROL DATABASE permission on the target database.

## Select objects
Choose the objects you want to migrate to the target.  By default all of the database objects are selected.  You can click on individual objects and see any issues associated with it.  For purposes of this quickstart, you don't need to be concerned with any of the listed issues.

When you're satisfied that all database objects are selected, click **Generate SQL scripts**.

## Script and deploy schema
You can review potential migration issues by clicking **Next issue** and **Previous issue**.  You should see a total of four instances of these two issues:

- Full-Text Search has changed since SQL Server 2008.
- SERVERPROPERTY('LCID') result differs from SQL Server 2000.

You don't need to be concerned with any of these issues, they are warnings and not errors.  When you're ready, click **Deploy schema**.

## Create Data Migration Service
Navigate to the Azure portal and click **+** to create a new service.  Data Migration Service is still in preview.  Search the marketplace for "migration" and select "Data Migration Service (preview)."
