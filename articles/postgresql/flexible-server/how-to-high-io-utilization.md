# Troubleshoot high IOPS utilization in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

This article shows you how to quickly identify the root cause of high IOPS utilization and possible remedial actions to control IOPS utilization when using [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](overview.md). 

In this article, you learn:

- About tools to identify high IO utilization, such as Azure Metrics, Query Store, and pg_stat_statements.
- How to identify root causes, such as long-running queries, checkpoint timings, disruptive autovacuum daemon process, and high storage utilization.
- How to resolve high IO utilization using Explain Analyze, tune checkpoint-related server parameters, and tune autovacuum daemon.

### Tools to identify high IO utilization

Consider these tools to identify high IO utilization.

#### Azure metrics

Azure Metrics is a good starting point to check the IO utilization for the definite date and period. Metrics give information about the time duration the IO utilization is high. Compare the graphs of Write IOPs, Read IOPs, Read Throughput, and Write Throughput to find out times when the workload caused high IO utilization. For proactive monitoring, you can configure alerts on the metrics. For step-by-step guidance, see [Azure Metrics](./howto-alert-on-metrics.md).

#### Query store

Query Store automatically captures the history of queries and runtime statistics and retains them for your review. It slices the data by time to see temporal usage patterns. Data for all users, databases, and queries is stored in a database named azure_sys in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance. For step-by-step guidance, see [Query Store](./concepts-query-store.md).

Use the following statement to view the top five SQL statements that consume IO:

```sql
select * from query_store.qs_view qv where is_system_query is FALSE 
order by blk_read_time + blk_write_time  desc limit 5;
```

#### pg_stat_statements

The pg_stat_statements extension helps identify queries that consume IO on the server.

Use the following statement to view the top five SQL statements that consume IO:

```sql
SELECT userid::regrole, dbid, query
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY blk_read_time + blk_write_time desc  
LIMIT 5;   
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using query store or pg_stat_statements for columns blk_read_time and blk_write_time to be populated enable server parameter `track_io_timing`.For more information about the **track_io_timing** parameter, review [Server Parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html). 

### Identify root causes 

If IO consumption levels are high in general, the following could be possible root causes: 

#### Long-running transactions  

Long-running transactions can consume IO, that can lead to high IO utilization.

The following query helps identify connections running for the longest time:  

```sql
SELECT pid, usename, datname, query, now() - xact_start as duration 
FROM pg_stat_activity  
WHERE pid <> pg_backend_pid() and state IN ('idle in transaction', 'active') 
ORDER BY duration DESC;   
```

#### Checkpoint timings

High IO can also be seen in scenarios where a checkpoint is happening too frequently. One way to identify this is by checking the Postgres log file for the following log text "LOG: checkpoints are occurring too frequently."

You could also investigate using an approach where periodic snapshots of `pg_stat_bgwriter` with a timestamp is saved. Using the snapshots saved the average checkpoint interval, number of checkpoints requested and number of checkpoints timed can be calculated. 

#### Disruptive autovacuum daemon process

Execute the below query to monitor autovacuum:

```sql
SELECT schemaname, relname, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup, autovacuum_count, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_autoanalyze, autovacuum_count, autoanalyze_count FROM pg_stat_all_tables WHERE n_live_tup > 0; 
```
The query is used to check how frequently the tables in the database are being vacuumed. 

**last_autovacuum**  : provides date and time when the last autovacuum ran on the table.      
**autovacuum_count** : provides number of times the table was vacuumed.    
**autoanalyze_count**: provides number of times the table was analyzed.   

### Resolve high IO utilization

To resolve high IO utilization, there are three methods you could employ - using Explain Analyze, terminating long-running transactions, or tuning server parameters.

#### Explain Analyze 

Once you identify the query that's consuming high IO, use **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** to further investigate the query and tune it. For more information about the **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** command, review [Explain Plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html). 

#### Terminating long running transactions   

You could consider killing a long running transaction as an option.

To terminate a session's PID, you need to detect the PID using the following query: 

```sql
SELECT pid, usename, datname, query, now() - xact_start as duration 
FROM pg_stat_activity  
WHERE pid <> pg_backend_pid() and state IN ('idle in transaction', 'active') 
ORDER BY duration DESC;   
```

You can also filter by other properties like `usename` (username), `datname` (database name) etc.  

Once you have the session's PID you can terminate using the following query:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
```

#### Server parameter tuning

If it's observed that the checkpoint is happening too frequently, increase `max_wal_size` server parameter until most checkpoints are time driven, instead of requested. Eventually, 90% or more should be time based, and the interval between two checkpoints is close to the `checkpoint_timeout` set on the server.

##### `max_wal_size`

Peak business hours is a good time to arrive at `max_wal_size` value. Follow the below listed steps to arrive at a value.

Execute the below query to get current WAL LSN, note down the result:

 ```sql
select pg_current_wal_lsn();
```

Wait for `checkpoint_timeout` number of seconds. Execute the below query to get current WAL LSN, note down the result:

 ```sql
select pg_current_wal_lsn();
```

Execute below query that uses the two results to check the difference in GB:

 ```sql 
select round (pg_wal_lsn_diff ('LSN value when run second time', 'LSN value when run first time')/1024/1024/1024,2) WAL_CHANGE_GB;
```      

##### `checkpoint_completion_target`

A good practice would be to set it to 0.9. As an example, a value of 0.9 for a `checkpoint_timeout` of 5 minutes indicates the target to complete a checkpoint is 270 sec [0.9*300 sec]. A value of 0.9 provides fairly consistent I/O load. An aggressive value of `check_point_completion_target` may result in increased IO load on the server.

##### `checkpoint_timeout`

The `checkpoint_timeout` value can be increased from default value set on the server.Please note while increasing the `checkpoint_timeout` take into consideration that increasing the value would also increase the time for crash recovery.

#### Autovacuum tuning to decrease disruptions

For more details on monitoring and tuning in scenarios where autovacuum is too disruptive please review [Autovacuum Tuning](./how-to-autovacuum-tuning.md).

####  Increase storage

Increasing storage will also help in addition of more IOPS to the server. For more details on storage and associated IOPS review [Compute and Storage Options](./concepts-compute-storage.md).
