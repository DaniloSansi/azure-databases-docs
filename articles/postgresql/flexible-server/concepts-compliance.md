Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments: globally applicable, US government, 
industry specific, and region/country specific. Compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft.
