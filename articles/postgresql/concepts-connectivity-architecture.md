# Azure Database for PostgreSQL Connectivity architecture
This article explains the Azure Database for PostgreSQL connectivity architecture as well as how the different components function to direct traffic to your instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL. These connectivity components function to direct network traffic to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL with clients connecting from within Azure and with clients connecting from outside of Azure. This article also provides script samples to change how connectivity occurs, and the considerations related to changing the default connectivity settings.

## Connectivity Architecture
The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL connectivity architecture.

![Overview of the connectivity architecture](./media/concepts-connectivity-architecture/connectivity-architecture-overview-proxy.png)

The following steps describe how a connection is established to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL:
* Clients connect to the gateway, that has a public IP address and listens on port 5432.
* Inside the database cluster traffic is forwarded to appropriate Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports **Proxy** mode for the connection policy setting of a MySQL Database server. In this mode, all connections are proxied via the Azure Database for MySQL gateways. To enable connectivity, the client must have outbound firewall rules that allow only the Azure Database for MySQL gateway IP addresses (usually two IP addresses per region). Choosing this mode can result in higher latency and lower throughput, depending on nature of the workload.

If you are connecting from outside Azure, your connections have a connection policy of Proxy by default. A policy of Proxy means that the TCP session is established via the Azure Database for MySQL gateway and all subsequent packets flow via the gateway. The following diagram illustrates this traffic flow.

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL gateway IP addresses
To connect to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL from on-premises resources, you need to allow outbound network traffic to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL gateway for your Azure region. Your connections only go via the gateway when connecting in Proxy mode, which is the default when connecting from on-premises resources.
The following table lists the primary and secondary IPs of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL gateway for all data regions. For some regions, there are two IP addresses. In these regions, the primary IP address is the current IP address of the gateway and the second IP address is a failover IP address. The failover address is the address to which we might move your server to keep the service availability high. For these regions, we recommend that you allow outbound to both the IP addresses. The second IP address is owned by Microsoft and does not listen in on any services until it is activated by Azure Database for PostgreSQL to accept connections.
