# Configure Hyperscale (Citus) high availability

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) provides high availability
(HA) to avoid database downtime.  With HA is enabled, a server group will use
twice as many nodes as without HA, because each node gets a standby.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because HA doubles the number of servers in the group, it will also double
> the cost.

To enable or disable HA, go to the **Configure** tab in your Hyperscale (Citus)
server group.  Drag the slider for **Highly Available** to ON or OFF.

Click the "Save" button to apply your selection. Enabling HA can take some time
as the server group provisions replicas and streams data to them.
