# What is Azure Database for PostgreSQL?
Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud built for developers based on the community version of open-source [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database engine. It is available in two deployment options: Single Server and Hyperscale (Citus) (preview).

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server
The Single Server deployment option delivers:

- Built-in high availability with no additional cost
- Predictable performance, using inclusive pay-as-you-go pricing
- Vertical scale as needed within seconds
- Secured to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion
- Automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

All those capabilities require almost no administration, and all are provided at no additional cost. These capabilities allow you to focus on rapid application development and accelerating your time to market, rather than allocating precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure. In addition, you can continue to develop your application with the open-source tools and platform of your choice, and deliver with the speed and efficiency your business demands without having to learn new skills.

The Single Server deployment option offers three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different resource capabilities to support your database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, and then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them. SeeÂ [Pricing tiers](concepts-pricing-tiers.md) for details.

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) (preview)
Besides providing the rich feature set of PostgreSQL, the Hyperscale (Citus) option horizontally scales queries across multiple machines using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching -- or already exceed -- 100 GB of data.

The Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option delivers:

- Horizontal scaling across multiple machines using sharding
- Query parallelization across these servers for faster responses on large datasets
- Excellent support for multi-tenant applications, real-time analytics, and time series data

Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard [connection libraries](./concepts-connection-libraries.md) and minimal changes.

## Data security
Azure database services have a tradition of data security that Azure Database for PostgreSQL upholds with features that limit access, protect data at-rest and in-motion, and help you monitor activity. Visit the [Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/trusted-cloud/) for information about Azure's platform security.

The Azure Database for PostgreSQL service uses storage encryption for data at-rest and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Data, including backups, is encrypted on disk (with the exception of temporary files created by the engine while running queries). The service uses AES 256-bit cipher that is included in Azure storage encryption, and the keys are system managed. Storage encryption is always on and cannot be disabled. By default, the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service is requires secure connections for data in-motion both across the network and between the database and client application.

## Contacts
For any questions or suggestions you might have about working with Azure Database for PostgreSQL, send an email to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Team ([@Ask Azure DB for PostgreSQL](mailto:AskAzureDBforPostgreSQL@service.microsoft.com)). Note that this is not a technical support alias.

In addition, consider the following points of contact as appropriate:
- To contact Azure Support or fix an issue with your account, [file a ticket from the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).
