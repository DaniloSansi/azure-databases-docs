# Hyperscale (Citus) performance tuning

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-postgresql-hyperscale](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-hyperscale.md)]

Running a distributed database at its full potential provides a lot of
performance. However, reaching that performance can take some adjustments in
application code and data modeling. This article covers some of the most common
-- and effective -- techniques to improve performance.

## Client-side connection pooling

A connection pool holds open database connections for reuse. An application
requests a connection from the pool when needed, and the pool returns one that
is already established if possible, or establishes a new one. When done, the
application releases the connection back to the pool rather than closing it.

Adding a client-side connection pool is an easy way to boost applicatiohn
performance with minimal code changes. In our measurements, running single-row
insert statements goes about **24x faster** on a Hyperscale (Citus) server
group with pooling enabled.

For language-specific examples of adding pooling in application code, see the
[app stacks guide](quickstart-app-stacks-overview.md).

> forms of pooling can be used at once without harm.)

## Efficient database logging

Logging all SQL statements all the time adds overhead. In our measurements,
using more a judicious log level improved the transactions per second by
**10x** vs full logging.

For efficient everyday operation, you can disable logging except for errors and
abnormally long-running queries:

| setting | value | reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| log_statement_stats | OFF | Avoid profiling overhead |
| log_duration | OFF | Don't need to know the duration of normal queries |
| log_statement | NONE | Don't log queries without a a more specific reason |
| log_min_duration_statement | A value longer than what you think normal queries should take | Shows the abnormally long queries |

> [!NOTE]

> These log settings are the default in PostgreSQL, except
> log_min_duration_statement, which by default is disabled (-1).

## Scoping distributed queries

When updating a distributed table, try to filter queries on the distribution
column. For instance, in our [multi-tenant
tutorial](tutorial-design-database-multi-tenant.md#use-psql-utility-to-create-a-schema)
we have an `ads` table distributed by `company_id`. The naive way to update an ad is
to single it out like this:

```sql
-- slow

UPDATE ads
   SET impressions_count = impressions_count+1
 WHERE id = 42; -- missing filter on distribution column
```

Although the query uniquely identifies a row and updates it, Hyperscale (Citus)
doesn't know at planning time which shard the query will update. Citus takes a
ShareUpdateExclusiveLock on all shards to be safe, which blocks other queries
trying to update the table.

Even though the `id` was sufficient to identify a row, we can include a redundant
additional filter to make the query faster:

```sql
-- fast

UPDATE ads
   SET impressions_count = impressions_count+1
 WHERE id = 42
   AND company_id = 1; -- the distribution column
```

The Hyperscale (Citus) query planner sees a direct filter on the distribution
column and knows exactly which single shard to lock. In our tests, adding
filters for the distribution column increased parallel update performance by
**100x**.

## Table bloat

## Lock contention

### Detecting locks

### Common problems and solutions

#### DDL commands

DDL Commands like `truncate`, `drop`, and `create index` all take write locks,
and block writes on the entire table. Minimizing such operations reduces
locking issues. Try to consolidate them into maintenance windows, or use them
less often.

#### Idle connections

Idle (uncommitted) transactions can unnecessary block other queries.

#### Locking hierarchy

Avoid deadlocks with a locking hierarchy.
