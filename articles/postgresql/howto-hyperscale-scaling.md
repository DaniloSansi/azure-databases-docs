# Scale a Hyperscale (Citus) server group

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) provides self-service
scaling to deal with increased load. The Azure Portal makes it easy to either
add new worker nodes or increase existing nodesâ€™ memory, disk, and CPU
capacity.

To scale worker nodes, go to the **Configure** tab in your Azure Database for
PostgreSQL server group. Adjust the sliders to change the values:

Applications send their queries to the coordinator node, which relays them to
the relevant workers and accumulates the results. Scaling the coordinator can
improve performance for queries which require large or CPU-intensive
aggregations. To do so, click **View configuration** and adjust the sliders:
