# Azure Database for PostgreSQL Threat Detection

Azure Database for PostgreSQL Threat Detection detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.

Threat Detection is part of the [SQL Advanced Threat Protection](sql-advanced-threat-protection.md) (ATP) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Threat Detection can be accessed and managed via the central SQL ATP portal.

## What is Threat Detection?

Azure Database for PostgreSQL Threat Detection provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. Users receive an alert upon suspicious database activities, and  potential vulnerabilities, as well as anomalous database access and queries patterns. Azure Database for PostgreSQL Threat Detection integrates alerts with [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/), which includes details of suspicious activity and recommends action on how to investigate and mitigate the threat. Azure Database for PostgreSQL Threat Detection makes it simple to address potential threats to the database without the need to be a security expert or manage advanced security monitoring systems.
