# Performance Recommendations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Performance Recommendations feature is in Public Preview.




## Permissions
**Owner** or **Contributor** permissions required to run analysis using the Performance Recommendations feature.

## Performance recommendations
The [Performance Recommendations](concepts-performance-recommendations.md) feature analyzes workloads across your server to identify indexes with the potential to improve performance.

1. Open **Performance Recommendations** from the **Support + troubleshooting** section of the menu bar on the Azure portal page for your PostgreSQL server.

2. Select **Analyze** and choose a database. This will begin the analysis.

3. Depending on your workload this may take many minutes to complete. Once the analysis is done, there will be a notification in the portal.

4. The **Performance Recommendations** window will show a list of recommendations if any were found. If it concludes that your workload needs no additional indexes, there will be no recommendation. 

5. A recommendation will show information about the relevant **Database**, **Table**, **Column**, and **Index Size**.

6. To implement the recommendation, copy the query text and run it from your client of choice.
