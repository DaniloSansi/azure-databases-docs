# What is Azure Database for PostgreSQL?

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the Microsoft
cloud built for developers. It's based on the community version of open-source
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database engine.

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

Hyperscale (Citus) is a deployment option that horizontally scales queries
across multiple machines using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming
SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It
serves applications that require greater scale and performance than other
deployment options: generally workloads that are approaching--or already
exceed--100 GB of data.

Hyperscale (Citus) delivers:

- Horizontal scaling across multiple machines using sharding
- Query parallelization across these servers for faster responses on large
  datasets
- Excellent support for multi-tenant applications, real-time operational
  analytics, and high throughput transactional workloads

Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale
(Citus) with standard [connection
libraries](./concepts-connection-libraries.md) and minimal changes.
