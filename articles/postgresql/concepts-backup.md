# Backups in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL automatically creates server backups and stores them in user configured locally redundant or geo-redundant storage. Backups are an essential part of any business continuity strategy because they protect your data from accidental corruption or deletion.

## Backups explained

Azure Database for PostgreSQL takes full, differential, and transaction log backups. These backups allow you to restore a server to a specific point-in-time within your configured backup retention period. The default backup retention period is 7 days. You can optionally configure it up to 35 days. By default, backups are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption.

You can use these backups to:

- Restore a server to a point-in-time within the retention period. This operation will create a new server with the original database.
- Restore a database to another geographical region if you have configured geo-redundant storage option for backup storage. This allows you to recover from a geographic disaster when you cannot access your server and database. It creates a new server anywhere in the world.
- To perform a restore, see [restore database from backups](howto-restore-server-portal.md).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you delete the server, all databases that belong to the server are also deleted and cannot be recovered. You cannot restore a deleted server.

## Backup redundancy options

Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides the flexibility to choose between locally redundant or geo-redundant backup storage in the General Purpose and Memory Optimized tiers. The geo-redundant backup storage provides better protection and ability to recover your server using geo-redundantly stored backup in the event of a disaster. The Basic tier only offers locally redundant backup storage. 

## Backup frequency

Generally, full backups occur weekly, differential backups occur twice a day, and transaction log backups occur every five minutes. The first full backup is scheduled immediately after a server is created. For example, the initial backup can take longer on a restored database.

## Backup storage cost

Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides up to 100% of your maximum provisioned server storage as backup storage at no additional cost. Typically, this is suitable for a backup retention of 7 days. Any additional backup storage used is charged per GB-month.

For example, if you have provisioned a server with 250 GB, you have 250 GB of backup storage at no additional charge. Storage in excess of 250 GB is charged.
