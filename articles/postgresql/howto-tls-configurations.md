# Configuring TLS settings in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server using Azure portal

This article describes how you can configure an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server to enforce a minimum TLS version for all incoming connections which helps improve the network security.

Security conscious customers now have the ability to enforce TLS version for connecting to their Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server. Customers now have a choice to set the minimal TLS version for their database server. For example, setting this Minimum TLS version to 1.0 means you shall allow clients connecting using TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. Alternatively, setting this to TLS 1.2 means that you only allow client connections using TLS 1.2 and reject connections with TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.

## Prerequisites

To complete this how-to guide, you need:

* An [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](quickstart-create-server-database-portal.md)

## Set TLS configurations for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server

Follow these steps to set PostgreSQL Single server minimum TLS version:

* In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single server.

* On the PostgreSQL Single server page, under **Settings** heading, click **Connection security** to open the connection security configuration page.

* In the **Minimum TLS version**, select **1.2** to deny connections with TLS version less than TLS 1.2 for your PostgreSQL Single server.
