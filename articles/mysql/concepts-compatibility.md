## MySQL Drivers
Since Azure Database for MySQL uses the world beloved community edition of MySQL database, it is compatible with a wide variety of popular program languages and drivers. Our goal is to support the most recent 3 versions MySQL drivers and we are working with authors from the open source community to constantly improve the functionality and usability of popular MySQL drivers. The table below documents a list of drivers that we have tested to be compatible with Azure Database for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7.

| **Driver** | **Links** | **Supported Versions** | **Versions with Known issues** | **Notes** |
| :-------- | :------------------------ | :----------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| PHP | http://php.net/downloads.php | 5.5 5.6 7.x | 5.3 | For PHP 7.0 connection with SSL MySQLi, add MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL_DONT_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT in the connection string. i.e.: mysqli_real_connect($conn, $host, $username, $password, $db_name, 3306,NULL,MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL_DONT_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT); PDO set: PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option to false.|

## Management Tools
Our compatibility advantage extends to database management tools as well. Your existing tools should continue to work with Azure Database for MySQL, as long as the database manipulation operates within the confines of user permissions. The following table shows 3 common database management tools that we have tested and compatible with Azure Database for MySQL 5.6 and 5.7.
