# Limits in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

This article describes capacity, storage engine support, privilege support, data manipulation statement support, and functional limits in Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Servers. [General limitations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-reslimits-excerpt/5.7/en/limits.html) in the MySQL database engine are also applicable. If you'd like to learn about resource (compute, memory, storage) tiers, see the [compute and storage](concepts-flexible-compute-storage.md) article.

## Server parameters

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking for min/max values for server parameters like `max_connections` and `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, this information has moved to the server parameters concepts <!-- **[server parameters](./concepts-server-parameters.md)** --> article.

Azure Database for MySQL supports tuning the values of server parameters. The min and max value of some parameters (ex. `max_connections`, `join_buffer_size`, `query_cache_size`) is determined by the pricing tier and vCores of the server. Refer to server parameters concepts <!-- [server parameters](./concepts-server-parameters.md)--> for more information about these limits.

## Storage engine support

### Supported
- [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-introduction.html)
- [MEMORY](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/memory-storage-engine.html)

### Unsupported
- [MyISAM](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisam-storage-engine.html)
- [BLACKHOLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/blackhole-storage-engine.html)
- [ARCHIVE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/archive-storage-engine.html)
- [FEDERATED](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/federated-storage-engine.html)

## Privilege support

### Unsupported
- DBA role: 
Many server parameters and settings can inadvertently degrade server performance or negate ACID properties of the DBMS. As such, to maintain the service integrity and SLA at a product level, this service does not expose the DBA role. The default user account, which is constructed when a new database instance is created, allows that user to perform most of DDL and DML statements in the managed database instance. 
- SUPER privilege: 
Similarly [SUPER privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super) is also restricted.
- DEFINER: 
Requires super privileges to create and is restricted. If importing data using a backup, remove the `CREATE DEFINER` commands manually or by using the `--skip-definer` command when performing a mysqldump.
- System databases:
In Azure Database for MySQL, the [mysql system database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/system-schema.html) is read-only as it is used to support various PaaS service functionality. Please note that you cannot change anything in the `mysql` system database.

## Data manipulation statement support

### Supported
- `LOAD DATA INFILE` is supported, but the `[LOCAL]` parameter must be specified and directed to a UNC path (Azure storage mounted through SMB).

### Unsupported
- `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`

## Functional limitations

### Stop/start operation

- Stop/start for servers with Zone-Redundant HA is currently not supported

### Scale operations

- Decreasing server storage size is currently not supported.

### Server version upgrades

- Automated migration between major database engine versions is currently not supported. If you would like to upgrade to the next major version, take a dump and restore <!--  [dump and restore](./howto-migrate-using-dump-and-restore.md)--> it to a server that was created with the new engine version.

### Restoring a server

- When using the Point-in-time-Restore feature, the new server is created with the same compute and storage configurations as the server it is based on.
- Restoring a deleted server is not supported.
