>[!NOTE]
> This article applies to Power BI Desktop only. Currently Power Query online is not supported. 

If you have business data stored in Azure database for MySQL Flexible Server then with Power BI Desktop you can visually explore your data through a free-form drag-and-drop canvas, a broad range of modern data visualizations, and an easy-to-use report authoring experiences. You can import directly from the tables or import from a SELECT query. 

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Power BI desktop](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).
2. If you are trying to connect with MySQL database for the first time in Power BI, you need to install the Oracle [MySQL Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/) package.
3. Skip the steps below if MySQL server has SSL disabled. If SSL is enabled then follow the steps below to install the certificate. 
   - Dowload the [SSL public certificate](https://dl.cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem). 
   - Install the SSL certificate in Trusted Root certification authorities store by following these steps: 
      - Start "certmgr.msc" Management Console on your Windows system.
      - Right-click Trusted Root Certification Authorities and select Import. 
      - Follow the prompts in the wizard to import the root certificate (for example, DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem) and click OK.
