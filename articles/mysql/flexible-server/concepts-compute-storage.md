# Compute and Storage options in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server is currently in public preview

You can create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server in one of three different pricing tiers: Burstable, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. The compute tiers are differentiated by the underlying VM SKU used B-series, D-series, and E-series. The choice of compute tier dictates the memory and vCores available on the server. The same storage technology is used across all compute tiers. All resources are provisioned at the MySQL server level. A server can have one or many databases.

| Resource / Tier | **Burstable** | **General Purpose** | **Memory Optimized** |
|:---|:----------|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| VM series| B-series | Ddsv4-series | Edsv4-series|
| vCores | 1, 2 | 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 | 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, 64 |
| Memory per vCore | Variable | 4 GiB | 8 GiB * |
| Storage size | 5 GiB to 16 TiB | 5 GiB to 16 TiB | 5 GiB to 16 TiB |
| Database backup retention period | 1 to 35 days | 1 to 35 days | 1 to 35 days |

\* With the exception of E64ds_v4 (Memory Optimized) SKU, which has 504 GB of memory

To choose a pricing tier, use the following table as a starting point.

| Pricing tier | Target workloads |
|:-------------|:-----------------|
| Burstable | Best for workloads that donâ€™t need the full CPU continuously. |
| General Purpose | Most business workloads that require balanced compute and memory with scalable I/O throughput. Examples include servers for hosting web and mobile apps and other enterprise applications.|
| Memory Optimized | High-performance database workloads that require in-memory performance for faster transaction processing and higher concurrency. Examples include servers for processing real-time data and high-performance transactional or analytical apps.|

After you create a server, the compute tier, number of vCores and storage size can be changed up or down within seconds. You also can independently adjust the backup retention period up or down. For more information, see the [Scale resources](#scale-resources) section.

## Compute tiers, vCores, and server types

Compute resources can be selected based on the tier, as well as the vCores and memory size. vCores represent the logical CPU of the underlying hardware.

The detailed specifications of the available server types are as follows:

| SKU Name             | vCores | Memory Size (GiB) | 
|----------------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Burstable**        |        |             | 
| B1s                  | 1      | 1           |  
| B1ms                 | 1      | 2           | 
| B2s                  | 2      | 4           |  
| **General Purpose**  |        |             | 
| D2ds_v4              | 2      | 8           |  
| D4ds_v4              | 4      | 16          | 
| D8ds_v4              | 8      | 32          | 
| D16ds_v4             | 16     | 64          | 
| D32ds_v4             | 32     | 128         |  
| D48ds_v4             | 48     | 192         |  
| D64ds_v4             | 64     | 256         | 
| **Memory Optimized** |        |             |
| E2ds_v4              | 2      | 16          |
| E4ds_v4              | 4      | 32          |
| E8ds_v4              | 8      | 64          |
| E16ds_v4             | 16     | 128         |
| E32ds_v4             | 32     | 256         |
| E48ds_v4             | 48     | 384         |
| E64ds_v4             | 64     | 504         |

To get more details about the compute series available, please refer to Azure VM documentation for [Burstable (B-series)](../../virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable.md), [General Purpose (Ddsv4-series)](../../virtual-machines/ddv4-ddsv4-series.md), and [Memory Optmized (Edsv4-series)](../../virtual-machines/edv4-edsv4-series.md).

## Storage

The storage you provision is the amount of storage capacity available to your flexible server. Storage is used for the database files, temporary files, transaction logs, and the MySQL server logs. In all compute tiers, the minimum storage supported is 5 GiB and maximum is 16 TiB. Storage is scaled in 1 GiB increments and can be scaled up after the server is created.

>[!NOTE]
> Storage can only be scaled up, not down.

You can monitor the your storage consumption in the Azure portal (with Azure Monitor) using the storage limit, storage percentage, and storage used metrics. <!-- add link to metrics doc-->

### Reaching the storage limit

When storage consumed on the server is close to reaching the provisioned limit, the server is put to read-only mode to protect any lost writes on the server. Servers with less than equal to 100 GiB provisioned storage are marked read-only if the free storage is less than 5% of the provisioned storage size. Servers with more than 100 GiB provisioned storage are marked read only when the free storage is less than 5 GiB.

For example, if you have provisioned 110 GiB of storage, and the actual utilization goes over 105 GiB, the server is marked read-only. Alternatively, if you have provisioned 5 GiB of storage, the server is marked read-only when the free storage reaches less than 256 MB.

While the service attempts to make the server read-only, all new write transaction requests are blocked and existing active transactions will continue to execute. When the server is set to read-only, all subsequent write operations and transaction commits fail. Read queries will continue to work uninterrupted. 

To get the server out of read-only mode, you should increase the provisioned storage on the server. This can be done using the Azure portal or Azure CLI. Once increased, the server will be ready to accept write transactions again.

We recommend that you set up an alert to notify you when your server storage is approaching the threshold so you can avoid getting into the read-only state. 

<!-- We recommend that you turn on storage auto-grow or to set up an alert to notify you when your server storage is approaching the threshold so you can avoid getting into the read-only state. For more information, see the documentation on alert documentation [how to set up an alert](howto-alert-on-metric.md).-->

### Storage auto-grow

Storage auto-grow is not yet available for Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.

## IOPS

In all compute tiers, the IOPS scale with the provisioned storage size in a 3:1 ratio. You can scale IOPS by increasing the provisioned storage. The minimum IOPS supported is 100. The maximum effective IOPS may be limited by the maximum available IOPS of the selected compute size and can be calculated using the below formula. You can refer to the column *Max uncached disk throughput: IOPS/MBps* in the [B-series](../../virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable.md), [Ddsv4-series](../../virtual-machines/ddv4-ddsv4-series.md), and [Edsv4-series](../../virtual-machines/edv4-edsv4-series.md) documentation for the maximum IOPS available for each compute size. In preview, the max IOPS supported is 20,000 IOPS.

**Max effective IOPS** = MINIMUM(maximum IOPS of compute size, storage provisioned in GiB * 3)

The table below shows the calculated maximum effective IOPS by compute size. 

| SKU Name             | Max effective IOPS  | 
|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Burstable**        |                     |
| B1s                  | 320                 |
| B1ms                 | 640                 |
| B2s                  | 1280                | 
| **General Purpose**  |                     |
| D2ds_v4              | 3200                |
| D4ds_v4              | 6400                |
| D8ds_v4              | 12800               |
| D16ds_v4             | 20000               |
| D32ds_v4             | 20000               |
| D48ds_v4             | 20000               | 
| D64ds_v4             | 20000               | 
| **Memory Optimized** |                     | 
| E2ds_v4              | 3200                | 
| E4ds_v4              | 6400                | 
| E8ds_v4              | 12800               | 
| E16ds_v4             | 20000               | 
| E32ds_v4             | 20000               | 
| E48ds_v4             | 20000               | 
| E64ds_v4             | 20000               |  

You can monitor your I/O consumption in the Azure portal (with Azure Monitor) using IO percent metric. <!-- add link to metrics doc-->

## Backup

The service automatically takes backups of your server. You can select a retention period from a range of 1 to 35 days. Learn more about backups in the backups article <!-- [concepts article](concepts-backup.md)-->.

## Scale resources

After you create your server, you can independently change the vCores, the compute tier, the amount of storage, and the backup retention period. The number of vCores can be scaled up or down. The backup retention period can be scaled up or down from 1 to 35 days. The storage size can only be increased. Scaling of the resources can be done through the portal or Azure CLI.<!--either through the portal or Azure CLI. For an example of scaling by using Azure CLI, see [Monitor and scale an Azure Database for MySQL server by using Azure CLI](scripts/sample-scale-server-up-or-down.md).-->

> [!NOTE]
> The storage size can only be increased. You cannot go back to a smaller storage size after the increase.

When you change the number of vCores or the compute tier, the server is restarted for the new server type to take effect. During the moment when the system switches over to the new server, no new connections can be established, and all uncommitted transactions are rolled back. This window varies, but in most cases, is less than a minute. 

Scaling storage and changing the backup retention period are online operations and do not require a server restart.

## Pricing

For the most up-to-date pricing information, see the service [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/MySQL/). To see the cost for the configuration you want, the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.MySQLServer/flexibleServers) shows the monthly cost on the **Compute + storage** tab based on the options you select. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can use the Azure pricing calculator to get an estimated price. On the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) website, select **Add items**, expand the **Databases** category, choose **Azure Database for MySQL**, and **Flexible Server** as the deployment type to customize the options.

If you would like to optimize for your server, you can consider following

- Scale down your compute tier or vCores if compute is underutilized.
- Consider switching to the Burstable compute tier if your workload doesn't need the full compute capacity continuously from the General Purpose and Memory Optimized tiers.
- Stop the server when not in use.
- Reduce the backup retention period if a longer retention of backup is not required.
