# Supported Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server versions

Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server has been developed from [MySQL Community Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/), using the InnoDB engine.

MySQL uses the X.Y.Z naming scheme. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the bug fix release. For more information about the scheme, see the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/which-version.html).

> [!NOTE]
> To determine the version of your MySQL server instance, use the `SELECT VERSION();` command at the MySQL prompt.

Azure Database for MySQL currently supports the following versions:

## MySQL Version 5.7

Bug fix release: 5.7.29

Refer to the MySQL [release notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-29.html) to learn more about improvements and fixes in this version.

## Managing updates and upgrades
The service automatically manages patching for bug fix version updates. For example, 5.7.29 to 5.7.30.
