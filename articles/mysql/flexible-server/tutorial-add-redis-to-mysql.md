# Tutorial: Boost performance of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server with Azure cache for Redis 

[[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-flexible-server.md)]

This article demonstrates how to connect improve the performance of an Azure Database for MySQL using Azure cache for Redis. 

## Prerequisites

For this quickstart you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. 

    [!INCLUDE [flexible-server-free-trial-note](../includes/flexible-server-free-trial-note.md)]
- Create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible server using [Azure portal](./quickstart-create-server-portal.md) <br/> or [Azure CLI](./quickstart-create-server-cli.md) if you do not have one.

## Populate the mysql database

Use mysql workbench and import database sample 

## Create a Redis cache 
[!INCLUDE [redis-cache-create](../../azure-cache-for-redis/includes/redis-cache-create.md)]

## Configure app service env variables 
In the repository you will find some Python code that you can run in your EC2 instance. But first you need to configure some environment variables:
```
syntax: shell
$ export REDIS_URL=redis://your_redis_endpoint:6379/
$ export DB_HOST=your_mysql_endpoint
$ export DB_USER=admin
$ export DB_PASS=your_admin_password
$ export DB_NAME=tutorial
Note that the values for mysql_endpoint, redis_endpoint, and password are those that you saved in the previous steps.
```

## Caching result of query 

The first of the two methods implemented in the code sample works by caching a serialized representation of the SQL query result. The following Python snippet illustrates the logic:
```
syntax: python
def fetch(sql):

  result = cache.get(sql)
  if result:
    return deserialize(result)
  else:
    result = db.query(sql)
    cache.setex(sql, ttl, serialize(result))
    return result
 ```   
 
 First, the SQL statement is used as a key in Redis, and the cache is examined to see if a value is present. If a value is not present, the SQL statement is used to query the database. The result of the database query is stored in Redis. The ttl variable must be set to a sensible value, dependent on the nature of your application. When the ttl expires, Redis evicts the key and frees the associated memory. This code is available in the tutorial repository and you can run it as is, but feel free to add print statements here and there if you want to see the value of a variable at a certain point in time.

In terms of strategy, the drawback of this approach is that when data is modified in the database, the changes wonâ€™t be reflected automatically to the user if a previous result was cached and its ttl has not elapsed yet.

An example of how you would use the fetch function:
```
syntax: python
print(fetch("SELECT * FROM planet"))
```

The result would be:
```
syntax: python
[{'id': 10, 'name': 'Mercury'},
 {'id': 11, 'name': 'Venus'},
 {'id': 12, 'name': 'Earth'},
 {'id': 13, 'name': 'Mars'},
 {'id': 14, 'name': 'Jupiter'},
 {'id': 15, 'name': 'Saturn'},
 {'id': 16, 'name': 'Uranus'},
 {'id': 17, 'name': 'Neptune'}]
 ```
