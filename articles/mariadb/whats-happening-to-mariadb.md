# __What's happening to Azure Database for MariaDB?__

 

Hello! We have news to share - __Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server is on the retirement path__ and Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server is scheduled for retirement by __September 16, 2024__.

As part of this retirement, we will no longer support creating new Single Server instances from the Azure portal beginning __January 16, 2023__. If you still need to create Single Server instances to meet business continuity needs, you can leverage [Azure CLI](/azure/mysql/single-server/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-cli). Additionally, you can still use your Terraform template to create single server instances. You will still be able to create read replicas for your existing single server instance from the __Replication blade__ and this will continue to be supported till the sunset date of __September 16, 2024__.

After years of evolving the Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server service, it can no longer handle all the new features, functions, and security needs. We recommend upgrading to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.

Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed production-ready database service designed for more granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings. For more information about Flexible Server, visit __[Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview)__.

If you currently have an Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server service hosting production servers, we're glad to let you know that you can migrate your Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server servers to the Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server service free of cost using Azure Database Migration Service (classic) . Review the different ways to migrate using Azure Data Migration Service (DMS) in the section below.

__Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)__

__Q. Why is Azure Database for MySQL-Single Server being retired?__

__A.__ Azure Database for MySQL – Single Server became Generally Available (GA) in 2018. However, given customer feedback and new advancements in the computation, availability, scalability and performance capabilities in the Azure database landscape, the Single Server offering needs to be retired and upgraded with a new architecture – Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server to bring you the best of Azure’s open-source database platform.

__Q. Why am I being asked to migrate to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server?__

__A.__ [Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/flexible-server/#overview) is the best platform for running all your MySQL workloads on Azure. Azure MySQL- Flexible server is both economical and provides better performance across all service tiers and more ways to control your costs, for cheaper and faster disaster recovery:

·       More ways to optimize costs, including support for burstable tier compute options.

·       Improved performance for business-critical production workloads that require low latency, high concurrency, fast failover, and high scalability.

·       Improved uptime with the ability to configure a hot standby on the same or a different zone, and a one-hour time window for planned server maintenance.

__Q. How soon do I need to migrate my single server to a flexible server?__

__A.__ Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server is scheduled for retirement by __September 16, 2024__, so we strongly recommend migrating your single server to a flexible server at your earliest opportunity to ensure ample time to run through the migration lifecycle, apply the benefits offered by Flexible Server, and ensure the continuity of your business.

__Q. What happens to my existing Azure Database for MySQL single server instances?__

__A.__ Your existing Azure Database for MySQL single server workloads will continue to function as before and will be officially supported until the sunset date. However, no new updates will be released for Single Server and we strongly advise you to start migrating to Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server at the earliest.

__Q. Can I choose to continue running Single Server beyond the sunset date?__

__A.__ Unfortunately, we don't plan to support Single Server beyond the sunset date of __September 16, 2024__, and hence we strongly advise that you start planning your migration as soon as possible.

__Q. After the Single Server retirement announcement, what if I still need to create a new single server to meet my business needs?__

__A.__ As part of this retirement, we will no longer support creating new Single Server instances from the Azure portal beginning __January 16, 2023__. If you still need to create Single Server instances to meet business continuity needs, you can leverage [Azure CLI](/azure/mysql/single-server/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-cli). Additionally, you can still use your Terraform template to create single server instances.

__Q. After the Single Server retirement announcement, what if I still need to create a new read replica for my single server instance?__

__A.__ You will still be able to create read replicas for your existing single server instance from the __Replication blade__ and this will continue to be supported till the sunset date of __September 16, 2024__.

__Q. Are there additional costs associated with performing the migration?__

__A.__ When running the migration, you pay for the target flexible server and the source single server. The configuration and compute of the target flexible server determines the additional costs incurred. For more information, see, [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/flexible-server/). Once you've decommissioned the source single server post successful migration, you only pay for your running flexible server. There are no costs incurred while running the migration through the Azure Database Migration Service (classic) migration tooling.

__Q. Will my billing be affected by running Flexible Server as compared to Single Server?__

__A.__ If you select same zone or zone redundant high availability for the target flexible server, your bill will be higher than it was on single server. Same zone or zone redundant high availability requires a hot standby server to be spun up along with storing redundant backup and hence the added cost. This architecture enables reduced downtime during unplanned outages and planned maintenance. In addition, depending on your workload, flexible servers can provide much better performance over single servers, whereby you may be able to run your workload with a lower SKU on flexible servers, and hence your overall cost may be similar to that of a single server.

__Q. Do I need to incur downtime for migrate Single Server to Flexible Server?__

__A.__ To limit any downtime you might incur, perform an online migration to Flexible Server, which provides minimal downtime.

__Q. Will there be future updates to Single Server to support latest MySQL versions?__

__A.__ The last minor version upgrade to Single Server version 8.0 will be 8.0.15. Consider migrating to Flexible Server to use the benefits of the latest version upgrades.

__Q. How does the flexible server’s 99.99% availability SLA differ from that of single server?__

__A.__ Flexible server’s zone-redundant deployment provides 99.99% availability with zonal-level resiliency whereas the single server provides resiliency in a single availability zone. Flexible Server’s High Availability (HA) architecture deploys a warm standby with redundant compute and storage (with each site’s data stored in 3x copies) as compared to single server’s HA architecture, which doesn't have a passive hot standby to help recover from zonal failures. The flexible server’s HA architecture enables reduced downtime during unplanned outages and planned maintenance.

__Q. What migration options are available to help me migrate my single server to a flexible server?__

__A.__ You can use Database Migration Service (classic) to run [online](/azure/dms/tutorial-mysql-azure-single-to-flex-online-portal) or [offline](/azure/dms/tutorial-mysql-azure-single-to-flex-offline-portal) migrations (recommended). In addition, you can use community tools such as m[ydumper/myloader together with Data-in replication](/azure/mysql/migrate/how-to-migrate-single-flexible-minimum-downtime) to perform migrations.

__Q. My single server is deployed in a region that doesn’t support flexible server. How should I proceed with migration?__

__A.__ Azure Database Migration Service (classic) supports cross-region migration, so you can select a suitable region for your target flexible server and then proceed with DMS (classic) migration.

__Q. I have private link configured for my single server, and this feature is not currently supported in Flexible Server. How do I migrate?__

__A.__ Private Link for flexible server is available now, and you can start migrating your single server.

__Q. I have cross-region read replicas configured for my single server, and this feature is not currently supported in Flexible Server. How do I migrate?__

__A.__ Cross-Region Read Replicas for flexible server (for paired region) is available now, and you can start migrating your single server.

__Q. I have TLS v1.0/1.1 configured for my v8.0 single server, and this feature is not currently supported in Flexible Server. How do I migrate?__

__A.__ To support modern security standards, MySQL community edition has discontinued support for communication over Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and 1.1 protocols starting with version 8.0.28. We recommend you upgrade your client drivers to support TLSv1.2 to connect securely to Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server and then proceed to migrate to Flexible Server.

__Q. Is there an option to rollback a Single Server to Flexible Server migration?__

__A.__ You can perform any number of test migrations, and after gaining confidence through testing, perform the final migration. A test migration doesn’t affect the source single server, which remains operational and continues replicating until you perform the actual migration. If there are any errors during the test migration, you can choose to postpone the final migration and keep your source server running. You can then reattempt the final migration after you resolve the errors. After you've performed a final migration to Flexible Server and the source single server has been shut down, you can't perform a rollback from Flexible Server to Single Server.

__Q. The size of my database is greater than 1 TB, so how should I proceed with an Azure Database Migration Service initiated migration?__

__A.__ To support Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) migrations of databases that are 1 TB+, raise a support ticket with Azure Database Migration Service to scale-up the migration agent to support your 1 TB+ database migrations.

__Q. Is cross-region migration supported?__

__A.__ Azure Database Migration Service supports cross-region migrations, so you can migrate your single server to a flexible server that is deployed in a different region using DMS.

__Q. Is cross-subscription migration supported?__

__A.__ Azure Database Migration Service supports cross-subscription migrations, so you can migrate your single server to a flexible server that deployed on a different subscription using DMS.

__Q. Is cross-resource group subscription supported?__

__A.__ Azure Database Migration Service supports cross-resource group migrations, so you can migrate your single server to a flexible server that is deployed in a different resource group using DMS.

__Q. Is there cross-version support?__

Yes, migration from lower version MySQL servers (v5.6 and above) to higher versions is supported through Azure Database Migration Service migrations.

__Q. I have further questions on retirement. How can I get assistance around it?__
