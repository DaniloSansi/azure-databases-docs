# Configure Data-in Replication in Azure Database for MariaDB

This article describes how to set up Data-in Replication in Azure Database for MariaDB by configuring the master and replica servers.

To create a replica in the Azure Database for MariaDB service, Data-in Replication synchronizes data from a master MariaDB server on-premises, in virtual machines (VMs), or in cloud database services.

We recommend that you set up the data-in replication with [Global Transaction ID](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/gtid/) if your master server's version is 10.2 or newer.

This article assumes that you have some prior experience with MariaDB servers and databases.

## Create a MariaDB server to use as replica

1. Create a new Azure Database for MariaDB server (for example, `replica.mariadb.database.azure.com`). This server is the replica server in Data-in Replication.

    To learn about server creation, see [Create an Azure Database for MariaDB server by using the Azure portal](quickstart-create-mariadb-server-database-using-azure-portal.md). 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must create the Azure Database for MariaDB server in the General Purpose or Memory Optimized pricing tiers.

2. Create identical user accounts and corresponding privileges. User accounts aren't replicated from the master server to the replica server. To provide users with access to the replica server, you must manually create all accounts and corresponding privileges on the newly created Azure Database for MariaDB server.

## Configure the master server
The following steps prepare and configure the MariaDB server hosted on-premises, in a VM, or in a database service hosted by other cloud providers for Data-in Replication. This server is the master in Data-in replication.

1. Turn on binary logging. To see if binary logging has been enabled on the master, enter the following command:

   ```sql
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
   ```

   If the variable [`log_bin`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/#log_bin) returns the value *ON*, binary logging is enabled on your server.

   If `log_bin` returns the value *OFF*, edit your **my.cnf** file so that `log_bin=ON` to turn on binary logging. Restart your server for the change to take effect.

2. Configure master server settings. Data-in Replication requires the parameter `lower_case_table_names` to be consistent between the master and replica servers. The `lower_case_table_names` parameter is `1` by default in Azure Database for MariaDB.

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL lower_case_table_names = 1;
   ```

3. Create a new replication role and set up permission

   Create a user account on the master server that's configured with replication privileges. You can create an account by using SQL commands or MySQL Workbench. If you plan to replicate with SSL, you must specify this when you create the user account.
   
   Refer to the MariaDB documentation to understand how to [add user accounts](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/create-user/) on your master server.

   In the following commands, the new replication role can access the master from any machine, not just the machine that hosts the master itself. Specify **syncuser\@'%'** in the create user command for this access.
   
   To learn more about MariaDB documentation, see [specifying account names](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/create-user/#account-names).

   **SQL Command**

   *Replication with SSL*

   To require SSL for all user connections, use the following command to create a user:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'syncuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO ' syncuser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
   ```

   *Replication without SSL*

   If SSL isn't required for all connections, use the following command to create a user:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'syncuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO ' syncuser'@'%';
   ```

   **MySQL Workbench**

   To create the replication role in MySQL Workbench, open the **Users and Privileges** panel from the **Management** panel. Then click on **Add Account**.
 
   ![Users and Privileges](./media/howto-data-in-replication/users_privileges.png)

   Type in the username into the **Login Name** field.

   ![Sync user](./media/howto-data-in-replication/syncuser.png)
 
   Click on the **Administrative Roles** panel and then select **Replication Slave** from the list of **Global Privileges**. Then click on **Apply** to create the replication role.

4. Set the master server to read-only mode

   Before dumping a database, the server must be placed in read-only mode. While in read-only mode, the master can't process any write transactions. To help avoid business impact, schedule the read-only window during an off-peak time.

   ```sql
   FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
   SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;
   ```

5. Get binary log file name and offset

   Run the [`show master status`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/show-master-status/) command to determine the current binary log file name and offset.
	
   ```sql
   show master status;
   ```
   The results should be like following. Make sure to note the binary file name as it will be used in later steps.

6. Get GTID position (Optional, needed for replication with GTID)

   Run the function [`BINLOG_GTID_POS`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/binlog_gtid_pos/) command to get the GTID position for the corresponding binlog file name and offset.
  
    ```sql
    select BINLOG_GTID_POS('<binlog file name>', <binlog offset>);
    ```
 

## Dump and restore master server

1. Dump all databases from master server

   You can use mysqldump to dump databases from your master. For details, see [Dump & Restore](howto-migrate-dump-restore.md). It isn't necessary to dump the MySQL library and test library.

2. Set master server to read/write mode

   Once the database has been dumped, change the master MariaDB server back to read/write mode.

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;
   UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```

3. Restore dump file to new server

   Restore the dump file to the server created in the Azure Database for MariaDB service. Refer to [Dump & Restore](howto-migrate-dump-restore.md) for how to restore a dump file to a MariaDB server.

   If the dump file is large, upload it to a VM in Azure within the same region as your replica server. Restore it to the Azure Database for MariaDB server from the VM.

## Link master and replica servers to start Data-in Replication

1. Set master server

   All Data-in Replication functions are done by stored procedures. You can find all procedures at [Data-in Replication Stored Procedures](reference-data-in-stored-procedures.md). The stored procedures can be run in the MySQL shell or MySQL Workbench.

   To link two servers and start replication, sign in to the target replica server in the Azure DB for MariaDB service. Next, set the external instance as the master server by using the `mysql.az_replication_change_master` or `mysql.az_replication_change_master_with_gtid` stored procedure on the Azure DB for MariaDB server.

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.az_replication_change_master('<master_host>', '<master_user>', '<master_password>', 3306, '<master_log_file>', <master_log_pos>, '<master_ssl_ca>');
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```sql
   CALL mysql.az_replication_change_master_with_gtid('<master_host>', '<master_user>', '<master_password>', 3306, '<master_gtid_pos>', '<master_ssl_ca>');
   ```

   - master_host: hostname of the master server
   - master_user: username for the master server
   - master_password: password for the master server
   - master_log_file: binary log file name from running `show master status`
   - master_log_pos: binary log position from running `show master status`
   - master_gtid_pos: GTID position from running `select BINLOG_GTID_POS('<binlog file name>', <binlog offset>);`
   - master_ssl_ca: CA certificate’s context. If not using SSL, pass in empty string.
       - We recommend that you pass this parameter in as a variable. For more information, see the following examples.

   **Examples**

   *Replication with SSL*

   The variable `@cert` is created by running the following commands: 

   ```sql
   SET @cert = '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   PLACE YOUR PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE’S CONTEXT HERE
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----'
   ```

   Replication with SSL is set up between a master server hosted in the domain “companya.com” and a replica server hosted in Azure Database for MariaDB. This stored procedure is run on the replica. 

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.az_replication_change_master('master.companya.com', 'syncuser', 'P@ssword!', 3306, 'mariadb-bin.000016', 475, @cert);
   ```
   *Replication without SSL*

   Replication without SSL is set up between a master server hosted in the domain “companya.com” and a replica server hosted in Azure Database for MariaDB. This stored procedure is run on the replica.

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.az_replication_change_master('master.companya.com', 'syncuser', 'P@ssword!', 3306, 'mariadb-bin.000016', 475, '');
   ```

2. Start replication

   Call the `mysql.az_replication_start` stored procedure to start replication.

   ```sql
   CALL mysql.az_replication_start;
   ```

3. Check replication status

   Call the [`show slave status`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/show-slave-status/) command on the replica server to view the replication status.
	
   ```sql
   show slave status;
   ```

   If the state of `Slave_IO_Running` and `Slave_SQL_Running` are *yes* and the value of `Seconds_Behind_Master` is *0*, replication is working well. `Seconds_Behind_Master` indicates how late the replica is. If the value isn't *0*, then the replica is processing updates.

4. Update correspond server variables to make data-in replication safer (required only for replication without GTID).
	
	Because of MariaDB native replication limitation, you must setup [`sync_master_info`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/#sync_master_info) and [`sync_relay_log_info`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/#sync_relay_log_info) variables on replication without GTID scenario. We recommand you check your slave server's `sync_master_info` and `sync_relay_log_info` variables and change them to `1` to make sure the data-in replication is stable.
	
## Other stored procedures

### Stop replication

To stop replication between the master and replica server, use the following stored procedure:

```sql
CALL mysql.az_replication_stop;
```

### Remove replication relationship

To remove the relationship between master and replica server, use the following stored procedure:

```sql
CALL mysql.az_replication_remove_master;
```

### Skip replication error

To skip a replication error and allow replication, use the following stored procedure:
	
```sql
CALL mysql.az_replication_skip_counter;
```
