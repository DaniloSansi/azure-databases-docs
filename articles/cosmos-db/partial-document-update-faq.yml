  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is this an implementation of JSON Patch RFC 6902?
        answer: |
          Azure Cosmos DB partial document update is *inspired* by [JSON Patch RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902). There are additional features such as [Conditional Patch](partial-document-update.md#supported-modes) while some of the features of JSON Patch RFC 6902 such as (`Copy`, `Move`, `Test`) have not been implemented.

      - question: |
          Is partial document update compatible with serverless, provisioned throughput and autoscale modes of billing?
        answer: |
          Yes, partial document update is available across serverless, provisioned throughput and autoscale modes.

      - question: |
          How is RU pricing calculated?
        answer: |
          Partial Document Update is normalized into request unit billing in the same way as [other database operations](how-pricing-works.md). Users should not expect a significant reduction in RU.

      - question: |
          Is there a limit to the number of partial document update operations?
        answer: |
          There is a limit of 10 patch operations that can be added in a single patch specification. If you need this number to be increased, please contact support team.

      - question: |
          Is partial document update supported for system generated properties?
        answer: |
          We do not support partial document update for system generated properties like `_id`, `_ts`, `_etag`, `_rid`.

      - question: |
          Can Time to Live (TTL) be patched?
        answer: |
          Yes, it is possible to patch [Time to Live](time-to-live.md) (`ttl`) property of a document.

      - question: |
          How does multi-region conflict resolution work in case of Arrays?
        answer: |
          Arrays are treated as an atomic unit. If the same property in an array is concurrently updated in different regions (thereby resulting in a conflict), only one of the changes will persist.

      - question: |
          Is partial document update supported on Azure CosmosDB emulator?
        answer: |
          Yes, partial document update support is also included in [Azure CosmosDB emulator](local-emulator.md).
