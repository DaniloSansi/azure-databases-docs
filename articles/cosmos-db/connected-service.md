# Azure Cosmos DB: Visual Studio Connected Service for CosmosDB

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases through Visual Studio Connected Service. 

You can also use Data Explorer to create stored procedures, UDFs, and triggers to perform server-side business logic as well as scale throughput. Data Explorer exposes all of the built-in programmatic data access available in the APIs, but provides easy access to your data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following items:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
    * Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md)  if you want to use a local environment that emulates the Azure DocumentDB service for development purposes.
* [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/).
* Install the latest CosmosDB ConnectedService bits. You can install it from [Here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858555).

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

Let's start by [creating an Azure Cosmos DB account](create-documentdb-dotnet.md) in the Azure portal or our connected service tool.

> [!TIP]
> * Already have an Azure Cosmos DB account? If so, skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio solution](#SetupVS)
> * If you are using the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator, follow the steps at [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md) to setup the emulator and skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio Solution](#SetupVS).
