# Azure Cosmos DB: Visual Studio Connected Service for CosmosDB

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, at the core of Azure Cosmos DB through Visual Studio Connected Service. 

You can also use Data Explorer to create stored procedures, UDFs, and triggers to perform server-side business logic as well as scale throughput. Data Explorer exposes all of the built-in programmatic data access available in the APIs, but provides easy access to your data.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
    * Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md)  if you'd like to use a local environment that emulates the Azure DocumentDB service for development purposes.
* [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/).

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

Let's start by [creating an Azure Cosmos DB account](create-documentdb-dotnet.md) in the Azure portal or in our connected service tool.

> [!TIP]
> * Already have an Azure Cosmos DB account? If so, skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio solution](#SetupVS)
> * If you are using the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator, please follow the steps at [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md) to setup the emulator and skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio Solution](#SetupVS).
