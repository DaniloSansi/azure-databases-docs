# Azure Cosmos DB: Visual Studio Connected Service

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases through Visual Studio Connected Service. 

The Connected Service for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio allows developers to connect to Azure Cosmos DB account easily and manage resources.

You can also use Data Explorer to create stored procedures, UDFs, and triggers to perform server-side business logic as well as scale throughput. Data Explorer exposes all of the built-in programmatic data access available in the APIs, but provides easy access to your data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following items:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
    * if you want to use a local environment that emulates the Azure DocumentDB service for development purposes, you can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md).
* [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/).
* Install the latest Azure Cosmos DB ConnectedService bits. You can install it from [Here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858709)

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

Let's start by [creating an Azure Cosmos DB account](create-documentdb-dotnet.md) in the Azure portal or our connected service tool.

> [!TIP]
> * Already have an Azure Cosmos DB account? If so, skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio solution](#SetupVS)
> * If you are using the Azure Cosmos DB Emulator, follow the steps at [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](local-emulator.md) to setup the emulator and skip ahead to [Set up your Visual Studio Solution](#SetupVS).

## <a id="SetupVS"></a>Set up your Visual Studio solution
1. Open **Visual Studio** in your computer.
2. On the **File** menu, select **New**, and then choose **Project**.
3. In the **New Project** dialog, select **Visual C#** / **Console App (.NET Framework)** or **WPF App (.NET Framework)**, name your project, and then click **OK**.

## Add ConnectedService and add account
1. Right click on Project node, select **Add** / **Connected Service** or click **Project** menu, select **Add Connected Service**.

    ![Screen shot of the Add Connected Service window](./media/connected-service/connected-service-add-connectedservice-rightclick.png)
2. In the connected service page, click **Connected Services** / **Azure Cosmos DB** to open **Azure Cosmos DB** page.

3. Click down arrow to sign in for the first time or add an Account. After sign-in, All Azure Cosmos DB accounts are shown in the blank area. Choose one Azure Cosmos DB account to add to your project.

    ![Screen shot of the sign in and listed db account window](./media/connected-service/connected-service-add-db-account.png)
4. After added a Azure Cosmos DB account, a Azure Cosmos DB account connected service folder was added to the project. You can add more than one Azure Cosmos DB account through repeating step 1 to step 3.

5. When you add a Azure Cosmos DB connected service, we would modify your project to enable access to Azure Cosmos DB database mainly in below two ways.
* Some nuget packages which is required by Azure Cosmos DB client are installed. we can see them from your packages configuration file. 

    ![The new Azure Cosmos DB packages config](./media/connected-service/connected-service-packages-config.png)   
* DocumentDB connection uri and key are added to project configuration file, in this case, App.config.

## Open Azure Cosmos DB Explorer
1. Right click on Project node, select **Open Cosmos DB Explorer...**.

    ![Screen shot of the try to Open Data Explorer window](./media/connected-service/connected-service-right-click-open-data-exporer.png)
2. In the **Choose a Cosmos DB Account** page, click dropdown list to select one Azure Cosmos DB account.

    ![Screen shot of the Added Account Connected Service window](./media/connected-service/connected-service-open-explorer.png)
3. Click **Open**, then data explorer window is shown.

## Create a New Azure Cosmos DB Account
1. In the connected service page, in the left bottom pane, click **Create a New Cosmos DB Account** to open **Create Cosmos DB Account** page.

    ![Screen shot of the open Create Azure Cosmos DB Account entry point window](./media/connected-service/connected-service-click-new-db-account.png)
2. On the **Create Cosmos DB Account** page, specify the configuration that you want for this Azure Cosmos DB account.

* Complete the fields on the **Create Cosmos DB Account** page, using information in the following screenshot as reference.

3. Click **Create** to create the account.

## Use Data Explorer

After opening Data Explorer, we can Create and Delete database, Create and Delete Collection. And Create and Delete documents, Filter Document, Create, and Delete Stored Procedure. Also we can  Create and Delete Triggers, Create, and Delete User-Defined Function to perform server-side business logic. For how to use Data Explorer, refers to [Azure Cosmos DB docs on Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/).

## Next Steps
In this document, you've learned following itmes:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure Cosmos DB account
> * Add ConnectedService and add account
> * Open Azure Cosmos DB Explorer
> * Use Data Explorer

You can now develop with the DocumentDB API in .NET.
