# Perform Azure Table storage operations with Azure PowerShell 

Azure Table Storage is a NoSQL datastore, which you can use to store and query huge sets of structured, non-relational data. The main components of the service are tables, entities, and properties. A table is a collection of entities. An entity is a set of properties. Each entity can have up to 252 properties, which are all name-value pairs. This article assumes that you are already familiar with the Azure Table Storage Service concepts. For detailed information, see [Understanding the Table Service Data Model](/rest/api/storageservices/Understanding-the-Table-Service-Data-Model) and [Get started with Azure Table storage using .NET](../../cosmos-db/table-storage-how-to-use-dotnet.md).

This how-to article covers common Table storage operations. You learn how to:

> * Create a table
> * Retrieve a table
> * Add table entities
> * Query a table
> * Delete table entities
> * Delete a table

This how-to includes instructions for creating a storage account in a new resource group so you can easily remove it at the end. If you'd rather use an existing storage account, you can do that instead.

The examples require Azure PowerShell module version 4.4.0 or later. In a PowerShell window, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If nothing is listed, or you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps. If you do the install using the instructions on that page, it will also install the storage table cmdlets that you need.

> [NOTE]
> These PowerShell commands should work for both classic Table Storage and Cosmos DB Tables. For more information, see [Azure RM Storage Tables PowerShell module for Cosmos DB Tables](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/paulomarques/2017/05/23/azure-rm-storage-tables-powershell-module-now-includes-support-for-cosmos-db-tables/).

## Sign in to Azure

Log in to your Azure subscription with the `Login-AzureRmAccount` command and follow the on-screen directions.

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

## Retrieve list of locations

If you don't know which location you want to use, you can list the available locations. After the list is displayed, find the one you want to use. This tutorial will use **eastus**. Store this in the variable **location** for future use.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmLocation | select Location 
$location = "eastus"
```

## Create resource group

Create a resource group with the [New-AzureRmResourceGroup](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/New-AzureRmResourceGroup) command. 

An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Store the resource group name in a variable for future use. In this example, a resource group named *howtotablesrg* is created in the *eastus* region.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "pshtablesrg"
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location
```

## Create storage account

Create a standard general-purpose storage account with locally-redundant storage (LRS) using [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/New-AzureRmStorageAccount). Get the storage account context that defines the storage account to be used. When acting on a storage account, you reference the context instead of repeatedly providing the credentials.

```powershell
$storageAccountName = "pshtablestorage"
$storageAccount = New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
  -Name $storageAccountName `
  -Location $location `
  -SkuName Standard_LRS `
  -Kind Storage

$ctx = $storageAccount.Context
```

## Create a new table

To create a table, use the [New-AzureStorageTable](/powershell/module/azure.storage/New-AzureStorageTable) cmdlet. In this example, the table is called `pshtesttable`.

```powershell
$tableName = "pshtesttable"
New-AzureStorageTable –Name $tableName –Context $ctx
```

## Retrieve a list of tables in the storage account

Retrieve a list of tables in the storage account using [Get-AzureStorageTable](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTable).

```powershell
$storageTable = Get-AzureStorageTable –Context $ctx | select Name
```

## Retrieve a reference to a specific table

To perform operations on a table, you need a reference to the specific table. Get a reference using [Get-AzureStorageTable](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTable). 

```powershell
$storageTable = Get-AzureStorageTable –Name $tableName –Context $ctx
```

## Managing table entities

Now that you have a table, let's look at how to manage entities in the table. 

### Add table entities

An entity can have up to 255 properties, including 3 system properties: **PartitionKey**, **RowKey**, and **Timestamp**. You are responsible for inserting and updating the values of **PartitionKey** and **RowKey**. The server manages the value of **Timestamp**, which cannot be modified. Together the **PartitionKey** and **RowKey** uniquely identify every entity within a table.

* **PartitionKey**: Determines the partition that the entity is stored in.
* **RowKey**: Uniquely identifies the entity within the partition.

You may define up to 252 custom properties for an entity. For more information, see [Understanding the Table Service Data Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179338.aspx).

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS

Add entities to a table using [Add-StorageTableRow](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Add-StorageTableRow). This uses partition keys with values "partition1" and "partition2", and rowkeys equal to state abbreviations. This was an arbitrary choice to make the example clear.

```powershell
$partitionKey1 = "partition1"
$partitionKey2 = "partition2"

# add four rows 
Add-StorageTableRow `
    -table $storageTable `
    -partitionKey $partitionKey1 `
    -rowKey ("CA") -property @{"username"="Chris";"id"=1}

Add-StorageTableRow `
    -table $storageTable `
    -partitionKey $partitionKey2 `
    -rowKey ("NM") -property @{"username"="Jessie";"id"=2}

Add-StorageTableRow `
    -table $storageTable `
    -partitionKey $partitionKey1 `
    -rowKey ("WA") -property @{"username"="Christine";"id"=3}

Add-StorageTableRow `
    -table $storageTable `
    -partitionKey $partitionKey2 `
    -rowKey ("TX") -property @{"username"="Steven";"id"=4}
```

### Query the table entities

There are several different ways to query the entities in a table. 

#### Retrieve all entities

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS
To retrieve all entities, use [Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll).

```powershell
Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll -table $storagetable | ft
```
Using the data and query above yields results similar to the following:

| id | username | partition | rowkey |
|----|---------|---------------|----|
| 1 | Chris | partition1 | CA |
| 3 | Christine | partition1 | WA |
| 2 | Jessie | partition2 | NM |
| 4 | Steven | partition2 | TX |

#### Retrieve entities for a specific partition

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS
To retrieve all entities in a specific partition, use [Get-AzureStorageTableRowByPartitionKey](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTableRowByPartitionKey).

```powershell
Get-AzureStorageTableRowByPartitionKey -table $storageTable -partitionKey $partitionKey1 | ft
```
The results look similar to the following:
| id | username | partition | rowkey |
|----|---------|---------------|----|
| 1 | Chris | partition1 | CA |
| 3 | Christine | partition1 | WA |

#### Retrieve entities for a specific value in a specific column

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS
To retrieve entities where the value in a specific column equals a specified value, use [Get-AzureStorageTableRowByColumnName](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTableRowByColumnName).

```powershell
Get-AzureStorageTableRowByColumnName -table $storageTable `
    -columnName "username" `
    -value "Chris" 
    -operator Equal
```

This retrieves one record.

id          : 1
username    : Chris
PartitionKey: partition1
RowKey      : CA

#### Retrieve entities using a custom filter 

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS
To retrieve entities using a custom filter, use [Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter).
s
```powershell
Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter -table $storageTable -customFilter "(id eq 1)"
```

This retrieves one record.

id          : 1
username    : Chris
PartitionKey: partition1
RowKey      : CA

### Updating entities 

**ROBIN** CHECK THE ENTITY LINKS
These are three steps for updating entities. First, retrieve the entity to be changed. Second, make the change. Third, commit the change using [Get-Update-AzureStorageTableRow](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Update-AzureStorageTableRow).s

* Retrieve the entity using a custom filter.

Update the entity with username = 'Jessie' to have username = 'Jessie2'. This also shows another way to create a custom filter using the .NET types. 

```powershell
# Create a filter and get the entity to be updated.
[string]$filter = `
    [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table.TableQuery]::GenerateFilterCondition("username",`
    [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table.QueryComparisons]::Equal,"Jessie")
$user = Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter -table $storageTable -customFilter $filter

# Change the entity.
$user.username = "Jessie2" 

# To commit the change, pipe the updated record into the update cmdlet.
$user | Update-AzureStorageTableRow -table $storageTable 

# To see the new record, query the table.
Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter -table $storageTable `
    -customFilter "(username eq 'Jessie2')"
```

This shows the Jessie2 record.

id          : 2
username    : Jessie2
PartitionKey: partition2
RowKey      : NM

### Deleting table entities

#### Deleting one entity

To delete a single entity, you get a reference to that entity and pipe it into [Remove-AzureStorageTableRow](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Remove-AzureStorageTableRow).

```powershell
# Set filter.
[string]$filter = `
  [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table.TableQuery]::GenerateFilterCondition("username",`
  [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table.QueryComparisons]::Equal,"Jessie2")

# Retrieve entity to delete it, then pipe it into the remove cmdlet.
$userToDelete = Get-AzureStorageTableRowByCustomFilter -table $storageTable -customFilter 
$userToDelete | Remove-AzureStorageTableRow -table $storageTable 

# Retrieve entities from table and see that Jessie2 has been deleted.
Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll -table $storagetable | ft
```

#### Delete all rows in the table 

To delete all rows in the table, you retrieve all rows and pipe the results into the remove cmdlet. 

```powershell
# Get all rows and pipe it into the remove cmdlet.
Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll `
    -table $storageTable | Remove-AzureStorageTableRow -table $storageTable 

# List entities in the table (there won't be any).
Get-AzureStorageTableRowAll -table $storagetable | ft
```

## Delete a table

To delete a table, use [Remove-AzureStorageTable](/powershell/module/azure.storage/Remove-AzureStorageTable). This removes the table, including all of its data.

```powershell
Remove-AzureStorageTable –Name $tableName –Context $ctx
# Retrieve the list of tables to verify our table has been removed.
Get-AzureStorageTable –Context $Ctx | select Name
```

## Clean up resources

If you created a new resource group and a new table in that group, you can remove all of the assets you have created in this exercise by removing the resource group. This deletes all resources contained within the group as well as the resource group itself.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup
```
