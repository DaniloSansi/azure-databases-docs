# Create a MEAN.js app with Azure Cosmos DB - Part 6: Add Post, Put, and Delete functions to the app

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part tutorial demonstrates how to create a new [MongoDB API](mongodb-introduction.md) app written in Node.js with Express and Angular and then connect it to your Azure Cosmos DB database. Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the exact same code that you use for MongoDB apps. By using Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB, you benefit from the deployment, scaling, security, and super-fast reads and writes that Azure Cosmos DB provides as a managed service. 

Part 6 of the tutorial covers the following tasks:

> * Create Post, Put, and Delete functions for the hero service
> * Run the app

## Prerequisites

Before starting this part of the tutorial, ensure you've completed the steps in [Part 5](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part5.md) of the tutorial.

## Add a Post function to the hero service

1. In Visual Studio Code, open **routes.js** and **hero.service.js** side by side by pressing the **Split Editor** button ![Split Editor button in Visual Studio](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/split-editor-button.png).

    See that routes.js line 7 is calling the getHeroes function on line 5 in hero.service.js.  We need to create this same pairing for the post, put, and delete functions. 

    ![routes.js and hero.service.js in Visual Studio Code](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/routes-heroservicejs.png)
    
    Let's start by coding up the hero service. 

2. Copy the following code into **hero.service.js** after the getHeroes function and before module.exports. This code:  
    * Uses the hero model to post a new hero.
    * Checks the responses to see if there's an error and returns a status value of 500.

    ```javascript
    function postHero(req, res) {
      const originalHero = { id: req.body.id, name: req.body.name, saying: req.body.saying };
      const hero = new Hero(originalHero);
      hero.save(error => {
        if (checkServerError(res, error)) return;
        res.status(201).json(hero);
        console.log('Hero created successfully!');
      });
    }

    function checkServerError(res, error) {
      if (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error);
        return error;
      }
    }
    ```

3. In hero.service.js, update the module.exports to include the new postHero function. 

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      getHeroes,
      postHero
    };
    ```

4. In **routes.js**, add a router for the post function after the get router. This router will post one hero at a time. This way the router file shows you all of the ways you can talk to your API - then all the real work is done by the hero.service.js.

    ```javascript
    router.post('/hero', (req, res) => {
      heroService.postHero(req, res);
    });
    ```

5. Check that everything worked by running the app. In Visual Studio Code, save all your changes, click the **Debug** button ![Debug icon in Visual Studio Code](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/debug-button.png) on the left side, then click the **Start Debugging** button ![Start debugging icon in Visual Studio Code](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/start-debugging-button.png).

6. Now go back to your internet browser and open the Developer tools Network tab by pressing F12 on most machines. Navigate to localhost:3000, and refresh the tab to watch the calls made over the network.

    ![Networking tab in Chrome that shows network activity](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/add-new-hero.png)

7. Add a new hero with an ID of 999, name of Fred, and saying Hello, then click **Save** and see that in the Networking tab that you're getting and posting new heroes. 

    ![Networking tab in Chrome that shows network activity for Get and Post functions](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/post-new-hero.png)

    Now lets go back and add the Put and Delete functions to the app.

## Add the Put and Delete functions

1. In **routes.js**, add the put and delete routers after the post router.

    ```javascript
    router.put('/hero/:id', (req, res) => {
      heroService.putHero(req, res);
    });

    router.delete('/hero/:id', (req, res) => {
      heroService.deleteHero(req, res);
    });
    ```

2. Copy the following code into **hero.service.js** after the **checkServerError** function. This code:

    * Creates the put and delete functions
    * Performs a check on whether the hero was found
    * Performs error handling 

    ```javascript
    function putHero(req, res) {
      const originalHero = {
        id: parseInt(req.params.id, 10),
        name: req.body.name,
        saying: req.body.saying
      };
      Hero.findOne({ id: originalHero.id }, (error, hero) => {
        if (checkServerError(res, error)) return;
        if (!checkFound(res, hero)) return;

       hero.name = originalHero.name;
        hero.saying = originalHero.saying;
        hero.save(error => {
          if (checkServerError(res, error)) return;
          res.status(200).json(hero);
          console.log('Hero updated successfully!');
        });
      });
    }

    function deleteHero(req, res) {
      const id = parseInt(req.params.id, 10);
      Hero.findOneAndRemove({ id: id })
        .then(hero => {
          if (!checkFound(res, hero)) return;
          res.status(200).json(hero);
          console.log('Hero deleted successfully!');
        })
        .catch(error => {
          if (checkServerError(res, error)) return;
        });
    }

    function checkFound(res, hero) {
      if (!hero) {
        res.status(404).send('Hero not found.');
        return;
      }
      return hero;
    }
    ```

3. In hero.service.js, export the new modules:

   ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      getHeroes,
      postHero,
      putHero,
      deleteHero
    };
    ```

4. Now that we've updated the code, click the **Restart** button ![Restart button in Visual Studio Code](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/restart-debugger-button.png) in Visual Studio Code.

5. Refresh the page in your internet browser and click the **Add New Hero** button. Add a new hero with an ID of 9, name set to Starlord, and saying set to Hi. Save the new hero.

6. Now select the **Starlord** hero, and change the saying from Hi to Bye, then click **Save**. 

    You can now select the ID in the Network tab to show the payload. You can see in the payload that the saying is now set to "Bye".

    ![Heroes app and Networking tab showing the payload](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/put-hero-function.png) 

    You can also delete one of the heroes in the UI, and see the times it takes to complete the delete operation.  

    ![Heroes app and the Networking tab showing the time to complete the functions](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part6/times.png) 

    If you refresh the page, the Network tab shows the time to get the heroes. While these times are fast, alot depends on where your data is located in the world and how you can geo replicate it to get it close to your users, which is what will be covered in the next tutorial.

## Next steps

In this part of the tutorial, you've learned how to add (Post), update (Put), and delete heroes from the app. 

The final installment of this multi-part tutorial, which involves globally replicating your data, is coming soon. Check back for updates.
