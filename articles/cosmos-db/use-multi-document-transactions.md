# Use Multi-Document Transactions

In this quickstart, you create and manage an Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin (graph) API account from the Azure portal, and add data by using a Python app cloned from GitHub. Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-model database service that lets you quickly create and query document, table, key-value, and graph databases with global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities.

## What are multi-document transactions?

## Requirements

## Sample

Let's add a mongo shell example below

1. Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.

    ```bash
    md "C:\git-samples"
    ```

2. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the `cd` command to change to a folder to install the sample app.  

    ```bash
    cd "C:\git-samples"
    ```

3. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-graph-python-getting-started.git
    ```



## Next steps

In this guide, you learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a graph using the Data Explorer, and run a Python app to add data to the graph. You can now build more complex queries and implement powerful graph traversal logic using Gremlin.
