# Manage Azure Cosmos DB in Azure Storage Explorer (Preview)

Azure Cosmos DB in Azure Storage Explorer allows users to manage Azure Cosmos DB entities, manipulate data, update stored procedure/trigger along with other Azure entities like blob and queue. Now users can use the same tool to manage their different Azure entities in one place. In this release, Document DB and MongoDB are supported.

In this article, you can learn how to use Storage Explorer to manage Azure Cosmos DB (Document DB API and MongoDB API).


## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a  [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) first.
- Create your own Azure Cosmos DB account on Azure portal, remember to choose “SQL (Document DB)” API or “Mongo” API, refer to this link: [Azure Cosmos DB: Build a DocumentDB API web app with .NET and the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Azure Cosmos-db/create-documentdb-dotnet).
- Install the newest Azure Storage Explorer bits. You can install it using the following links: [Linux](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858559), [Mac](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858561), [Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858562).

## Connect to Azure subscription

1. After installing the **Azure Storage Explorer**, click the **plug-in** icon on the left as shown blow, then choose **Add an Azure Account**.

    So far, you have successfully connected to your **Azure Cosmos DB account** through Azure subscription.

## Connect to Azure Cosmos DB by Connection String

Instead of connecting to subscription, you can also choose to connect to Azure Cosmos DB by Connection String, follow steps:

1. Find **Local and Attached** in the left tree, right-click **Azure Cosmos DB Accounts**, choose **Connect to Azure Cosmos DB...**

## Azure Cosmos DB resource management

You can manage Azure Cosmos DB account by doing following operations:
* Open in Portal, Add to Quick Access, Search, Refresh
* Database: create, delete
* Collection: create, delete
* Document: create, edit, delete, and filter
* Manage Stored Procedures, Triggers, and User-Defined Functions

### Open in Portal, Add to Quick Access, Search, Refresh

1. Right-click an Azure Cosmos DB account or a database, you can choose **Open in Portal** and manage the resource in browser on Azure portal.

     ![open in portal](./media/tutorial-documentdb-and-mongodb-in-storage-explorer/open-in-portal.png)

2. You can also add Azure Cosmos DB account, Database, Collection to **Quick Access**.
3. **Search from Here** enables keywords search under the selected path.

### Database and Collection management

1. **Create Database**: Right-click the Azure Cosmos DB account, choose **Create Database**, input the database name, **Enter** to complete.

    ![delete database2](./media/tutorial-documentdb-and-mongodb-in-storage-explorer/delete-database2.png) 

3. **Create Collection**: Right-click your database, choose **Create Collection**, and then provide the following information like Collection ID, Storage capacity, etc. Click **OK** to finish. For partition key setting, refer to this link:  [Design for partitioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Azure Cosmos-db/partition-data#designing-for-partitioning).
If partition key is used when creating collection, once creation is completed, the partition key value can't be changed in documents, the Stored Procedure, Trigger, and UDF can't be changed once saved.
