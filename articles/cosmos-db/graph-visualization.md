# Visualize graph data stored in Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API with data visualization solutions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-gremlin-api](includes/appliesto-gremlin-api.md)]

You can visualize data stored in Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API by using various data visualization solutions. The following solutions are recommended by the [Apache Tinkerpop community](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/#poweredby) for graph data visualization.

## Linkurious Enterprise

:::image type="content" source="./media/graph-visualization/linkurious-logo.jpg" alt-text="Linkurious Logo" border="false":::

[Linkurious Enterprise](https://linkurio.us/product/) uses graph technology and data visualization to turn complex datasets into interactive visual networks. The platform connects to your data sources and enables investigators to seamlessly navigate across billions of entities and relationships. The result is a new ability to detect suspicious relationships without juggling with queries or tables.

The interactive interface of Linkurious Enterprise offers an easy way to investigate complex data. You can search for specific entities, expand connections to uncover hidden relationships, and apply layouts of your choice to untangle complex networks. Linkurious Enterprise is now compatible with Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API. It's suitable for end-to-end graph visualization scenarios and supports read and write capabilities from the user interface. You can request a [demo of Linkurious with Azure Cosmos DB](https://linkurio.us/contact/)

## Tom Sawyer
:::image type="content" source="./media/graph-visualization/tomsawyer/tomsawyer-logo.png" alt-text="Tomsawyer Logo" border="false":::

Tom Sawyer Graph Database Browser makes it easy to visualize and analyze data in Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API. The Graph Database Browser helps you see and understand connections in your data without extensive knowledge of the query language or the schema. So, less technical users can interact with the data by loading the neighbors of selected nodes and building the visualization in whatever direction they need. Advanced users can run queries using Gremlin, Cypher, or SPARQL to gain other insights.
Users of all skill levels can take advantage of the five unique graph layouts to display the graph in a meaningful way. This tool offers built-in centrality, clustering, and path-finding analyses to reveal previously unseen patterns. Using these techniques, organizations can identify critical patterns in areas like fraud detection, customer intelligence, and cybersecurity. Pattern recognition is also important to network analysts in areas such as general IT and network management, logistics, legacy system migration, and business transformation.

## Graphlytic
:::image type="content" source="./media/graph-visualization/graphlytic/graphlytic_logo.png" alt-text="Graphlytic Logo" border="false":::

Graphlytic is a highly customizable web application for graph visualization and analysis. Users can interactively explore the graph, look for patterns with the Gremlin language, or use filters to find answers to any graph question. Graph rendering is done with the Cytoscape.js library which allows Graphlytic to render tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of relationships at once.
Graphlytic is compatible with Azure Cosmos DB and can be deployed in Azure in minutes.
Graphlytic’s UI can be customized and extended in many ways, for instance the default [visualization configuration](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Visualization_settings.html), [data schema](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Data_schema.html), [style mappings](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Style_mappers.html), [virtual properties](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Virtual_properties.html) in the visualization, or custom implemented [widgets](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Widgets.html) that can enhance the visualization features with bespoke reports or integrations.
The following are two example scenarios:
- IT Management use case
Companies running their IT operations on their own infrastructure, Telco, or IP providers, all need a solid network documentation and a functional configuration management. Impact analyses describing interdependencies among network elements (active and passive) are being developed to overcome blackouts, which cause significant financial losses, or even single outages causing no or low availability of service. Bottlenecks and single points of failure are determined and solved. Endpoint as well as route redundancies are being implemented.
Graphlytic property graph visualization is a perfect enabler for all above mentioned points - network documentation, network configuration management, impact analysis and asset management. It stores and depicts all relevant network configuration information in one place, bringing a completely new added value to IT managers and field technicians.

- Anti-fraud use case
Fraud pattern is a well-known term to every single insurance company, bank or e-commerce enterprise. Modern fraudsters build sophisticated fraud rings and schemes that are hard to unveil with traditional tools. It can cause serious losses if not detected properly and on time. On the other hand, traditional red flag systems with too strict criteria must be adjusted to eliminate false positive indicators, as it would lead to overwhelming fraud indications. Great amounts of time are spent trying to detect complex fraud, paralyzing investigators in their daily tasks.
The basic idea behind Graphlytic is the fact that the human eye can simply distinguish and find any pattern in a graphical form much easier than in any table or data set. It means that the antifraud analyst can capture fraud schemes within graph visualization more easily, faster and smarter than with solely traditional tools.
