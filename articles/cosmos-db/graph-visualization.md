# Visualize your graph data in Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API with data visualization solutions

The following solutions are recommended by the Apache Tinkerpop community [as visualization solutions](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/#poweredby) for Gremlin graph databases.

## Linkurious Enterprise

Linkurious Enterprise uses graph technology and data visualization to turn complex datasets into interactive visual networks. The platform connects to your data sources and enables investigators to seamlessly navigate across billions of entities and relationships. The result is a new ability to detect suspicious relationships without juggling with queries or tables.

The interactive visualization interface of Linkurious Enterprise offers an easy way to investigate complex connected data. Search for specific entities, expand connections to uncover hidden relationships and apply layouts of your choice to untangle complex networks. Linkurious is now compatible with Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API, and it's suitable for end-to-end graph visualization scenarios with support for read/write capabilities from the interface.
