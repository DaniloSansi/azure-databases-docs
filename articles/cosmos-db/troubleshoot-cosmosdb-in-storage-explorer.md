# Cosmos DB in Storage Explorer Troubleshooting Guide Overview

[Azure Cosmos DB in Azure Storage Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/storage-explorer) is a standalone app that allows you to connect to Cosmos DB accounts hosted on Azure and Sovereign Clouds from Windows, macOS, or Linux. It enables you to manage Azure Cosmos DB entities, manipulate data, update stored procedures and triggers along with other Azure entities like Storage blobs and queues.

This guide summarizes solutions for common issues seen for Azure Cosmos DB in Storage Explorer.

## Sign in Issues

Before proceeding further, try restarting your application and see if the problems can be fixed.

## Self-Signed Certificate in Certificate Chain

There a few reasons you may be seeing this error, the two most common ones are:

1. You're behind a “transparent proxy”, which means someone (such as your IT department) is intercepting HTTPS traffic, decrypting it, and then encrypting it using a self-signed certificate.

2. You're running software, such as anti-virus software, which is injecting a self-signed SSL certificates into the HTTPS messages you receive.

When Storage Explorer encounters one of these "self-signed certificates", it can no longer know if the HTTPS message it's receiving has been tampered with. If you have a copy of the self-signed certificate though, then you can tell Storage Explorer to trust it. If you're unsure of who is injecting the certificate, then you can try to find it yourself by doing the following steps:

1. Install Open SSL
     - [Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) (any of the light versions should suffice)
     - Mac and Linux: Should be included with your operating system
2. Run Open SSL
    - Windows: Go to the install directory, then /bin/, then double-click on openssl.exe.
    - Mac and Linux: execute "openssl" from a terminal
3. Execute `s_client -showcerts -connect microsoft.com:443`
4. Look for self-signed certificates. If you're unsure, which are self-signed, then look for anywhere the subject ("s:") and issuer ("i:") are the same.
5.	Once you have found any self-signed certificates, copy and paste everything from and including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` to `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` to a new .cer file for each one.
6.	Open Storage Explorer and then go to Edit -> SSL Certificates -> Import Certificates. Using the file picker, find, select, and open the .cer files you created.

If you're unable to find any self-signed certificates using the above steps, could send feedback for more help.

## Unable to retrieve subscriptions

If you're unable to retrieve your subscriptions after you successfully signed in:

- Verify your account has access to the subscriptions by signing into the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com/)
- Make sure you have signed in using the correct environment ([Azure](http://portal.azure.com/), [Azure China](https://portal.azure.cn/), [Azure Germany](https://portal.microsoftazure.de/), [Azure US Government](http://portal.azure.us/), or Custom Environment/Azure Stack)
- If you're behind a proxy, make sure that you have configured the Storage Explorer proxy properly
- Try removing and readding the account
- Try deleting the following files from your home directory (such as: C:\Users\ContosoUser), and then readding the account:
  - `.adalcache`
  - `.devaccounts`
  - `.extaccounts`
- Watch the developer tools console (f12) while signing in for any error messages

## Unable to see the authentication page

If you're unable to see the authentication page:

- Depending on the speed of your connection, it may take a while for the sign-in page to load, wait at least one minute before closing the authentication dialog
- If you're behind a proxy, make sure that you have configured the Storage Explorer proxy properly
- Bring up the developer console by pressing F12 key. Watch the responses from developer console and see if you can find any clue for why authentication is not working

## Cannot remove account

If you're unable to remove an account, or if the reauthenticate link does not do anything

- Try deleting the following files from your home directory, and then readding the account:
  - `.adalcache`
  - `.devaccounts`
  - `.extaccounts`
- If you want to remove SAS attached Storage resources, delete:
  - %AppData%/StorageExplorer folder for Windows
  - /Users/<your_name>/Library/Applicaiton SUpport/StorageExplorer for Mac
  - ~/.config/StorageExplorer for Linux
  - **You will have to reenter all your credentials** if you delete these files


## Http/Https Proxy Issue

You cannot list Cosmos DB nodes in left tree when configuring http/https proxy in ASE. It's a known issue, and will be fixed in next release. You could use Cosmos DB data explorer in Azure portal as a work-around at this moment. 

## \`Development\` node under \`Local and Attached\` Issue

There is no response after clicking the \`Development\` node under \`Local and Attached\` in left tree.  The behavior is expected. Cosmos DB local emulator will be supported in next release.

## Attaching Cosmos DB account in \`Local and Attached\` Error

If you see below error after attaching Cosmos DB account in \`Local and Attached\`, then check if you're using the right connection string.

## Expand Cosmos DB node Error

You may see below error while trying to expand the tree nodes in left. 

![Expand Error](./media/troubleshoot-cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer/expand-error.png)

Try the following suggestions:

- Check if the Cosmos DB account is in provision progress and try again when the account is being created successfully.
- If the account is under \`Quick Access\` or \`Local and Attached\` nodes, then check if the account has been deleted. If so, you need to remove the node manually.

## Submit Your Issue 

If none of the solutions work for you, send email to Cosmos DB Dev Tooling Team ([cosmosdbtooling@microsoft.com](mailto:cosmosdbtooling@microsoft.com)) with details about the issue, for fixing the issues.
