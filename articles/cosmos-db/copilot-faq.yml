  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          What can Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB do?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB can help you write NoSQL queries on your own data with ease and confidence to boost your productivity through AI powered natural language to query generation.
      - question: |
          What data was used to train the Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in [Azure OpenAI that are pretrained](../ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md) then configured to generate Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL queries and natural language explanations.
      - question: |
          How does a user get the most out of Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          Users can get the most out of their experience by following these steps: 
          - Input a prompt for AI to generate a query on a specific Azure Cosmos DB collection. Users can type a natural language prompt in the Microsoft Copilot box and select the Generate Query arrow button. Microsoft Copilot then generates an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL query that matches the prompt and display it in the query editor along with an explanation. 
          - Modify the prompt to be more specific and regenerate the query: If the user isn't satisfied with the query generated by Copilot, they can select on the Regenerate button to ask the AI to generate a different query based on the refined prompt.  
          - Send feedback via the thumbs up and thumbs down: Users can provide feedback to the Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB team by clicking on the thumbs up or thumbs down icons next to the query. This feedback is used to improve the performance quality of Microsoft Copilot responses.

          Markdown content
      - question: |
          How is the transmitted prompt and query data protected?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB takes several measures to protect data including: 
            - The transmitted data is encrypted both in transit and at rest; Copilot-related data is encrypted in transit using TLS, and at rest using Microsoft Azure’s data encryption (FIPS Publication 140-2 standards). 
            - Access to log and feedback data is strictly controlled. The data is stored in separate AME subscription. The data is only accessible by 1) Just-In-Time JIT approval by [SAW machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/infrastructure-components).
      - question: |
          Will my private prompts, queries, or data be shared with others?
        answer: |
          No. Prompts, queries, and any other data aren't shared with others.
      - question: |
          Where can I learn more about privacy and data protection?
        answer: |
          For more information on how Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB processes and uses personal data, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
  - name: Terms and limitations
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where can I find the preview terms for using Azure OpenAI-powered previews like Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          For more information, see our [preview terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/#AzureOpenAI-PoweredPreviews).
      - question: |
          What is Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB's intended use?
        answer: |
          You can generate Cosmos DB NoSQL queries from your own natural language questions and prompts within the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer. Each generated output also contains a natural (English) language description of the query operations. While in public preview, the performance and accuracy can be limited. Humans should review and validate all queries before use.
      - question: |
          How was Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB is evaluated with test data and prompts on several metrics including: 
            - Validity: The generated query is a valid Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL query that can be executed on the selected container. 
            - Correctness: The generated query is one that would be expected in response to the user's prompt. 
            - Accuracy: The generated query returns the results that are relevant to and expected for the user’s prompt.
      - question: |
          What are the limitations of Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB is a feature that helps users write NoSQL queries for Azure Cosmos DB by providing suggestions based on natural language input. However, it has some limitations that users should be aware of and try to minimize. Some of the limitations are: 
            - Rate limits: Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB limits how many queries a user can execute. If a user exceeds five calls per minute, or 8 hours of total usage per day, they can receive an error message. The user will then have to wait until the next time window to use Copilot again.
            - Limited accuracy: Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB is in public preview, which means that performance and accuracy can be limited. Humans should review and validate all queries before use. 
            - The queries generated might not be accurate and provide the results the user intended to receive. Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB isn't a perfect system and can sometimes generate queries that are incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant. These errant queries could happen due to:
              - Ambiguity in the natural language prompt
              - Limitations of the underlying natural language processing
              - limitations of the underlying query generation models
              - Other issues.            
            - Users should always review the queries generated by Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB and verify that they match their expectations and requirements. Users should also provide feedback to the Microsoft Copilot team if they encounter any errors or issues with the queries. Users can submit feedback directly through Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB UI feedback buttons. 
            - English-only support: Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB officially supports English as the input and output language. Users who want to use Microsoft Copilot in other languages can experience degraded quality and accuracy of results.
      - question: |
          Does Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB write perfect or optimal queries?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB aims to provide accurate and informative responses based on the available data. The answers generated by Microsoft Copilot are based on patterns and probabilities in language data, which means that they might not always be accurate. Humans should carefully review, test, and validate all content generated by Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB. 

          To mitigate the risk of sharing unexpected offensive content in results and displaying potentially harmful articles, Microsoft Copilot has several measures in place. Despite these measures, you can still encounter unexpected results. We’re constantly working to improve our technology to proactively address issues in line with our [responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/our-approach)
      - question: |
          What should I do if I see unexpected or offensive outputs?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Copilot for Azure in Cosmos DB utilizes Azure OpenAI customized content filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. It's a feature that helps users write NoSQL queries for Azure Cosmos DB and uphold our principles on [responsible AI](../ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter.md).
