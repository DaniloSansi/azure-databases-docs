# Azure Cosmos DB attachments

Azure Cosmos DB attachments are special items that contain references to an associated metadata with an external blob or media file.

Azure Cosmos DB supports two types of attachments:

1. **Unmanaged Attachments** are a wrapper around an URI reference to a blob that is stored in an external service (for example, Azure Storage, OneDrive, etc.). This approach is similar to storing a URI property in a standard Azure Cosmos DB item.
2. **Managed Attachments** are blobs managed and stored internally by Azure Cosmos DB and exposed via a system-generated mediaLink.


> [!NOTE]
> Attachment is a legacy feature. Their support is scoped to offer continued functionality if you are already using this feature.
> 
> We recommend customers to use Azure Blob Storage, as a purpose-built blob storage service, for storing blob data instead of using attachments. Users can continue to store metadata related to blobs, along with reference URI links, in Azure Cosmos DB as item properties to provide the ability to query metadata and link to blobs stored in Azure Blob Storage.
> 
> Microsoft is committed to provide a minimum 36-month notice prior to fully deprecating attachments – which will be announced at a further date.

## Known Limitations

Azure Cosmos DB’s managed attachments are distinct from its support for standard items – for which it offers unlimited scalability, global distribution, and integration with other Azure services.

- Attachments aren't supported in all versions of Azure Cosmos DB’s SDKs.
- Managed attachments are limited to 2 GB of storage per database account.
- Managed attachments aren't compatible with Azure Cosmos DB’s global distribution, and aren't replicated across regions.

## Next Steps

- Get started with [Azure Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet)
- Get references for using attachments via [Azure Cosmos DB’s .NET v2 SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.attachment?view=azure-dotnet)
- Get references for using attachments via [Azure Cosmos DB’s REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cosmos-db/attachments)
