# Migrate from the bulk executor library to the bulk support in Azure Cosmos DB .NET V3 SDK

This article describes the required steps to migrate an existing application's code that uses the [.NET bulk executor library](bulk-executor-dot-net.md) to the [bulk support](tutorial-sql-api-dotnet-bulk-import.md) feature in the latest version of the .NET SDK.

## Enable bulk support

Enable bulk support on the `CosmosClient` instance through the [AllowBulkExecution](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.cosmosclientoptions.allowbulkexecution) configuration:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="Initialization":::

## Create Tasks for each operation

Bulk support in the .NET SDK works by leveraging the [Task Parallel Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) and grouping operations that occur concurrently. 

There is no single method that will take your list of documents or operations as an input parameter, but rather, you need to create a Task for each operation you want to execute in bulk.

If our initial input is a list of items where each item has, for example, this schema:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="Model":::

If you want to do bulk import (similar to using BulkExecutor.BulkImportAsync), it means you need to have concurrent calls to `CreateItemAsync` with each item value. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkImport":::

If you want to do bulk *update* (similar to using [BulkExecutor.BulkUpdateAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkexecutor.bulkupdateasync)), it means you need to have concurrent calls to `ReplaceItemAsync` after updating the item value. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkUpdate":::

And if you want to do bulk *delete* (similar to using [BulkExecutor.BulkDeleteAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkexecutor.bulkdeleteasync)), it means you need to have concurrent calls to `DeleteItemAsync`, with the `id` and partition key of each item. For example:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="BulkDelete":::

## Capture task result state

In the previous code examples, we are creating a concurrent list of Tasks, and on each of them, calling `CaptureOperationResponse`. This method is an extension that lets us maintain a *similar response schema* as BulkExecutor, by capturing any errors and tracking the [request units usage](request-units.md).

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="CaptureOperationResult":::

Where the `OperationResponse` is declared as:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="OperationResult":::

## Execute operations concurrently

With the list of Tasks defined, all we need to do is wait until they are all completed, defining the *scope* of our bulk operation. Easily done by:

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="WhenAll":::

## Capture statistics

The code above waits until all operations are completed and calculates the required statistics.

These statistics are similar to that of the bulk executor library's [BulkImportResponse](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmosdb.bulkexecutor.bulkimport.bulkimportresponse).

   :::code language="csharp" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/BulkExecutorMigration/Program.cs" ID="ResponseType":::

The `BulkOperationResponse` will contain:

1. The total time taken to process the list of operations through bulk support.
1. The number of successful operations.
1. The total of request units consumed.
1. If any failures happened, a list of tuples containing the captured Exception and the associated item for logging and identification purposes.

## Performance improvements

As with other operations with the .NET SDK, using the stream APIs will be better performance-wise by avoiding any unnecessary serialization. 

It is only possible if the nature of the data we work with matches that of a stream of bytes (for example, file streams). In those cases, using the `CreateItemStreamAsync`, `ReplaceItemStreamAsync`, or `DeleteItemStreamAsync` APIs and working with `ResponseMessage` (instead of `ItemResponse`) will increase the throughput that can be achieved.
