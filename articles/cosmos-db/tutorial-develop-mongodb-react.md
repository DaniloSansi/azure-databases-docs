# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a MongoDB API app using React, Node, and Express

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. With Azure Cosmos DB, can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part video tutorial demonstrates how to create a new hero tracking app with a React front-end. The app uses APIs for Node and Express, connects to the Azure Cosmos DB and the [MongoDB API](mongodb-introduction.md), and then connects the React front-end to the server portion of the app. You'll also learn how to do point and click scaling in the Azure portal and how to can deploy this app to the internet so everyone can track their favorite heroes. 

Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the same code that you use for MongoDB apps but with added benefits. These benefits from Azure Cosmos DB are simple cloud deployment, scaling, security, and super-fast reads and writes.  

This multi-part tutorial covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Introduction
> * Setup your React project
> * Build the UI with Angular
> * Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure portal
> * Use Mongoose to connect to Azure Cosmos DB
> * Add Post, Put, and Delete functions to the app

## Introduction 

In this video Burke gives an introduction to Azure Cosmos DB and walks you through the app that is created in this video series.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this tutorial in the Azure portal. 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've learned how to:
