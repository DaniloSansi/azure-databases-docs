# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a MongoDB API app using React, Node, and Express

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. With Azure Cosmos DB, can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part video tutorial demonstrates how to create a new hero tracking app front end using React, an API with Node and Express, connect that to Azure Cosmos DB and the [MongoDB API](mongodb-introduction.md), and then connect the React portion to the server portion. You'll also learn how to scale Azure Cosmos DB using point and click in the Azure portal, and then how we can deploy this app to the internet so everyone can track their favorite heroes. 

Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the exact same code that you use for MongoDB apps. By using Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB, you benefit from the deployment, scaling, security, and super-fast reads and writes that Azure Cosmos DB provides as a managed service. 

This multi-part tutorial covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Introduction
> * Setup your React project
> * Build the UI with Angular
> * Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure portal
> * Use Mongoose to connect to Azure Cosmos DB
> * Add Post, Put, and Delete functions to the app

## Introduction 

In this video Burke gives an introduction to Azure Cosmos DB and walks you through the app that is created in this video series.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this tutorial in the Azure portal. 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've done the following:

> * Create an Azure Cosmos DB account
> * Connect the app to the Azure Cosmos DB account
> * Test the app using Postman
> * Run the application and add heroes to the database

The final installment of this multi-part tutorial, which involves globally replicating your data, is coming soon. Check back for updates. 

You can proceed to the next tutorial and learn how to import MongoDB data into Azure Cosmos DB.
