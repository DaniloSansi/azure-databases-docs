# Partitioning in Cassandra API

This article describes how partitioning works in Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API. 

Cassandra API uses partitioning to scale individual tables in a keyspace to meet the performance needs of your application. In partitioning, the records in a table are divided into distinct subsets called logical partitions. Logical partitions are formed based on the value of a partition key that is associated with each record in a table. All records in a logical partition have the same partition key value. 

From the developer perspective, partitioning behaves in exactly the same way for Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API as it does in native [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/). There are some minor differences behind the scenes. Apache Cassandra has a concept of tokens, which are hashes of logical partition keys. The tokens are based on a murmur3 64 byte hash, with values ranging from -2^63 to -2^63 - 1. This range is commonly referred to as the "token ring" in Apache Cassandra. 

The token ring is distributed into token ranges, and these ranges are divided amongst the nodes present in a native Apache Cassandra cluster. Partitioning for Azure Cosmos DB is implemented in a similar way, except it uses a different hash algorithm, and has a larger token ring. You can learn how Partitioning and horizontal scaling works behind the scenes in Azure Cosmos DB [here](partition-data.md).


## Primary Key

All tables in Cassandra API must have a `primary key` defined. Suppose we want to create a user table, which stores messages for different users:

```shell
CREATE TABLE uprofile.user ( 
   id UUID PRIMARY KEY, 
   user text,  
   message text);
```

In this design, we have defined the `id` field as the `primary key`. The primary key functions as the identifier for the record in the table, but is also the value used as the `partition key` in Azure Cosmos DB. If the primary key is defined in the manner above, there will only be a single record in each logical partition. Although this will result in a perfect distribution when writing the data to the database, it has limitations for reading the data. Unless the primary key is supplied by the application in the query, all physical partitions will be scanned.

## Compound primary key

Apache Cassandra also has a concept of compound keys, which is the combination of a `primary key` and a `clustering key`. Suppose we want to change the above design and make it possible to efficiently retrieve messages for a given user:

```shell
CREATE TABLE uprofile.user (
   user text,  
   id int, 
   message text, 
   PRIMARY KEY (user, id));
```

A compound `primary key` consists of more than one column; the first column is the `partition key`, and any additional columns are the `clustering keys`. In this design, we are now defining `user` as the `partition key`, and `id` as the `clustering key`. You can define as many clustering keys as you wish, but each value (or combination of values) must be unique in order to result in multiple records being added to the same logical partition, for example:

```shell
insert into uprofile.user (user, id, message) values ('theo', 1, 'hello');
insert into uprofile.user (user, id, message) values ('theo', 2, 'hello again');
```

With data modeled in this way, we can issue a query that is efficiently routed by the `partition key` (in this case, `user`). Multiple records can thus be assigned to each logical partition, grouped by user:

## Composite partition key

Composite partition keys work in essentially the same way as compound keys, except that you are able to specify separate columns as a composite partition key, for example:

```shell
CREATE TABLE uprofile.user ( 
   firstname text, 
   lastname text,
   id int,  
   message text, 
   PRIMARY KEY ((firstname, lastname), id) );
```
In this example, the unique combination of firstname and lastname would form the partition key.
