# Tutorial: Migrate your data to a MongoDB API account in Azure Cosmos DB

As a developer, you might have applications that use NoSQL document data. You can use a MongoDB API account in Azure Cosmos DB to store and access this document data. You can also migrate data from your existing applications to the MongoDB API. This tutorial provides instructions on how to migrate data stored in MongoDB to a MongoDB API account in Azure Cosmos DB. If you import data from MongoDB and plan to use it with the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, you should use the [Data Migration tool](import-data.md) to import the data.

In this tutorial, you will:

> * Prepare a migration plan.
> * Migrate data by using mongoimport.
> * Migrate data by using mongorestore.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

Review and complete the following prerequisites before you start the migration.

### Plan for the migration

This section describes how to plan for the data migration. We'll estimate the RU charges, determine the latency from your machine to the cloud service, and calculate the batch size and number of insertion workers.


#### Pre-create and scale your collections

By default, Azure Cosmos DB provisions a new MongoDB collection with 1,000 request units per second (RU/sec). Before you migrate with mongoimport or mongorestore, pre-create all your collections from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or from MongoDB drivers and tools. If the data size is more than 10 GB, create a partitioned collection with an appropriate shard key.

From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), increase your collections throughput for the migration from 1,000 RUs/sec for a single partition collection and 2,500 RUs/sec for a sharded collection. With the higher throughput, you can avoid rate limiting and migrate in less time. You can reduce the throughput immediately after the migration to save costs.

In addition to provisioning RUs/sec at the collection level, you can also provision RUs/sec for a set of collections at the parent database level. At the parent level, you must pre-create the database and collections and define a shard key for each collection.

You can create sharded collections by using your preferred tool, driver, or SDK. In this example, we use the Mongo Shell to create a sharded collection:

```bash
db.runCommand( { shardCollection: "admin.people", key: { region: "hashed" } } )
```
    
The command returns the following results:

```JSON
{
    "_t" : "ShardCollectionResponse",
    "ok" : 1,
    "collectionsharded" : "admin.people"
}
```

#### Calculate the approximate RU charge for a single document write

From the MongoDB Shell, connect to your MongoDB API account in Azure Cosmos DB. You can find instructions in [Connect a MongoDB application to Azure Cosmos DB](connect-mongodb-account.md).

Next, run a sample insert command by using one of your sample documents:
   
```bash
db.coll.insert({ "playerId": "a067ff", "hashedid": "bb0091", "countryCode": "hk" })
```
        
Run the command `db.runCommand({getLastRequestStatistics: 1})`.

You receive a response like the following output:
     
```bash
globaldb:PRIMARY> db.runCommand({getLastRequestStatistics: 1})
{
    "_t": "GetRequestStatisticsResponse",
    "ok": 1,
    "CommandName": "insert",
    "RequestCharge": 10,
    "RequestDurationInMilliSeconds": NumberLong(50)
}
```
        
Take note of the request charge.
    
#### Determine the latency from your machine to the Azure Cosmos DB cloud service
    
Enable verbose logging from the MongoDB Shell with the command `setVerboseShell(true)`.
    
Run a basic query against the database with the command `db.coll.find().limit(1)`.

You receive a response like the following output:

```bash
Fetched 1 record(s) in 100(ms)
```
        
Before you run the migration, remove the inserted document to ensure there are no duplicate documents. You can remove documents with the command `db.coll.remove({})`.

#### Calculate the approximate values for the batchSize and numInsertionWorkers properties

For the **batchSize** property, divide the total provisioned RUs by the RUs consumed from your single document write, as completed in the section "Determine the latency from your machine to the Azure Cosmos DB cloud service." If the calculated value is less than or equal to 24, use that number as the property value. If the calculated value is greater than 24, set the property value to 24.
    
For the value of the **numInsertionWorkers** property, use this equation:

`numInsertionWorkers = (Provisioned RUs throughput * Latency in seconds) / (batchSize * Consumed RUs for a single write)`

We can use the following values to calculate a value for the **numInsertionWorkers** property:

| Property | Value |
|--------|-----|
| **batchSize** | 24 |
| Provisioned RUs | 10,000 |
| Latency | 0.100 s |
| Consumed RUs | 10 RUs |
| **numInsertionWorkers** | (10,000 RUs x 0.100 s) / (24 x 10 RUs) = **4.1666** |

Run the **monogoimport** migration command. The command parameters are described later in this article.

```bash
mongoimport.exe --host cosmosdb-mongodb-account.documents.azure.com:10255 -u cosmosdb-mongodb-account -p <Your_MongoDB_password> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --jsonArray --db dabasename --collection collectionName --file "C:\sample.json" --numInsertionWorkers 4 --batchSize 24
```

You can also use the **monogorestore** command. Make sure all collections have the throughput set at or above the number of RUs used in the previous calculations.
   
```bash
mongorestore.exe --host cosmosdb-mongodb-account.documents.azure.com:10255 -u cosmosdb-mongodb-account -p <Your_MongoDB_password> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates ./dumps/dump-2016-12-07 --numInsertionWorkersPerCollection 4 --batchSize 24
```

### Complete the prerequisites

After you plan for migration, complete the following steps: 

* **Get sample data**: Make sure you have some sample MongoDB data before you start the migration. If you don't have a sample MongoDB database, you can download and install the [MongoDB community server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center), create a sample database, and use the mongoimport.exe or mongorestore.exe to upload sample data. 

* **Increase throughput**: The duration of your data migration depends on the amount of throughput you set up for an individual collection or a set of collections. Be sure to increase the throughput for larger data migrations. After you complete the migration, decrease the throughput to save costs. 

* **Enable SSL**: Azure Cosmos DB has strict security requirements and standards. Be sure to enable SSL when you interact with your account. The procedures in this article include how to enable SSL for the mongoimport and mongorestore commands.

* **Create Azure Cosmos DB resources**: Before you start the migration, pre-create all your collections from the Azure portal. If you migrate to an Azure Cosmos DB account that has database-level throughput, make sure to provide a partition key when you create the Azure Cosmos DB collections.

* **Get your connection string**: In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **Azure Cosmos DB** entry on the left. Under **Subscriptions**, select your account name. Under **Connection String**, select **Connection String**. The right side of the portal shows the information you need to connect to your account:

## Use mongoimport

To import data to your Azure Cosmos DB account, use the following template.

```bash
mongoimport.exe --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file "C:\sample.json"
```

Replace the \<your_hostname>, \<your_username>, and \<your_password> parameters with the specific values for your account. In the following example, we use **sampleDB** as the value for \<your_database>, and **sampleColl** as the value for \<your_collection>:

```bash
mongoimport.exe --host cosmosdb-mongodb-account.documents.azure.com:10255 -u cosmosdb-mongodb-account -p <Your_MongoDB_password> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --db sampleDB --collection sampleColl --type json --file "C:\Users\admin\Desktop\*.json"
```

## Use mongorestore

To restore data to your API for MongoDB account, use the following template to execute the import.

```bash
mongorestore.exe --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates <path_to_backup>
```

Replace the \<your_hostname>, \<your_username>, and \<your_password> parameters with the specific values for your account. In the following example, we use **./dumps/dump-2016-12-07** as the value for \<path_to_backup>:

```bash
mongorestore.exe --host cosmosdb-mongodb-account.documents.azure.com:10255 -u cosmosdb-mongodb-account -p <Your_MongoDB_password> --db mydatabase --collection mycollection --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates ./dumps/dump-2016-12-07
```

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources, you can delete the resource group, Azure Cosmos DB account, and all the related resources. Use the following steps to delete the resource group:

1. Go to the resource group where you created the Azure Cosmos DB account.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Confirm the name of the resource group to delete, and select **Delete**.
