# Consistency levels and Azure Cosmos DB APIs

Azure Cosmos DB provides native support for wire protocol-compatible APIs for popular databases. These include MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Gremlin, and Azure Table storage. These databases do not offer precisely defined consistency models or SLA-backed guarantees for the consistency levels. They typically provide only a subset of the five consistency models offered by Azure Cosmos DB.

When using SQL API, Gremlin API, and Table API, the default consistency level configured on the Azure Cosmos account is used. 

When using Cassandra API or Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB, applications get a full set of consistency levels offered by Apache Cassandra and MongoDB, respectively, with even stronger consistency and durability guarantees. This document shows the corresponding Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels for Apache Cassandra and MongoDB consistency levels.

> [!NOTE]
> The default consistency model for Azure Cosmos DB is Session. Session is a client-centric consistency model which is not natively supported by either Cassandra or MongoDB. For more information on which consistency model to choose see, [Consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB](consistency-levels.md)

## <a id="cassandra-mapping"></a>Mapping between Apache Cassandra and Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels

Unlike Azure Cosmos DB, Apache Cassandra does not natively provide precisely defined consistency guarantees.  Instead, Apache Cassandra provides a write consistency level and a read consistency level, to enable the high availability, consistency, and latency tradeoffs. When using Azure Cosmos DB’s Cassandra API: 

* There is no configuration for write consistency level in Cassandra API; all writes have a consistency of local quorum, with commits always being durable, and written to 3 out of 4 replicas (commits in Apache Cassandra have an in-memory option). There is no precise equivalent for this in Apache Cassandra. 

* For read consistency, the following table shows the Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels, and the closest analogue to Apache Cassandra, given a write consistency setting of "Quorum" in Cassandra (which is the closest analogue to Cosmos DB's write consistency, per above). Note that "Session" and "Eventual" consistency do not have a direct equivalent in Apache Cassandra (see [consistency levels](consistency-levels.md) for more detail on the Azure Cosmos DB consistency settings). The table gives a mapping of what will be applied when configuring consistency *at the database level*:

* When mapping read consistency dynamically on a *per request basis*, Azure Cosmos DB will map the read consistency level specified by the Apache Cassandra client driver in the following way to Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels:

## <a id="mongo-mapping"></a>Mapping between MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels

Unlike Azure Cosmos DB, the native MongoDB does not provide precisely defined consistency guarantees. Instead, native MongoDB allows users to configure the following consistency guarantees: a write concern, a read concern, and the isMaster directive - to direct the read operations to either primary or secondary replicas to achieve the desired consistency level.

When using Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB, the MongoDB driver treats your write region as the primary replica and all other regions are read replica. You can choose which region associated with your Azure Cosmos account as a primary replica. 

While using Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB:

* The write concern is mapped to the default consistency level configured on your Azure Cosmos account.

* Azure Cosmos DB will dynamically map the read concern specified by the MongoDB client driver to one of the Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels that is configured dynamically on a read request.  

* You can annotate a specific region associated with your Azure Cosmos account as "Master" by making the region as the first writable region. 

The following table illustrates how the native MongoDB write/read concerns are mapped to the Azure Cosmos consistency levels when using Azure Cosmos DB’s API for MongoDB:
