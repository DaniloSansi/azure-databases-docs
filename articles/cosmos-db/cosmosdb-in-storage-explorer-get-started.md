# Use Cosmos DB in Azure Storage Explorer

Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed database service designed to enable developer to build planet scale applications. Cosmos DB allows you to quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases. 

Cosmos DB on Azure Storage Explorer allows users to manage Cosmos DB entities, manipulate data, update stored procedure/trigger along with other Azure entities like blob and queue. Now users can use the same tool to manage their different Azure entities in one place. In this release, Document DB and MongoDB are supported.

In this article, you can learn how to use Storage Explorer (Preview) to work with Cosmos DB (Document DB API and MongoDB API).


## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription. If you don't have, create a  [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) first.
- Create your own Cosmos DB account on Azure portal, remember to choose “SQL (Document DB)” API or “Mongo” API, refer to this link: [Azure Cosmos DB: Build a DocumentDB API web app with .NET and the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/create-documentdb-dotnet).
- Install the newest Azure Storage Explorer bits. You can install it by the following links: [Linux](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858559), [Mac](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858561), [Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858562).



## Connect to Azure subscription

1. After installing the **Azure Storage Explorer**, click the third **plug-in** icon on the left, then choose **Add an Azure Account**.

2. In the **Azure Sign In** dialog box, select **Sign in**, and then enter your Azure credentials.

3. **Apply** your subscription, you can see all Azure Cosmos DB account and Storage account under the subscription you choose.

    ![apply](./media/cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer-get-started/apply-subscription.png)

    ![account list](./media/cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer-get-started/account-list.png)

    So far, you have successfully connected to your **Cosmos DB account** through Azure subscription.

## Connect to Cosmos DB by Connection String

Instead of connecting to subscription, you can also choose to connect to Cosmos DB by Connection String, following steps below:

1. Find **Local and Attached** in the left tree, right-click **Azure Cosmos DB Accounts**, choose **Connect to Cosmos DB...**

    ![connect to Cosmos DB by connection string](./media/cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer-get-started/connect-to-cosmosdb-by-connection-string.png)

2. Choose Cosmos DB API, paste your **Connection String**, click **OK** to connect Cosmos DB account.

## Cosmos DB resource management

You can manage Cosmos DB account by doing following operations:
* Open in Portal, Add to Quick Access, Search, Refresh
* Database: create, delete
* Collection: create, delete
* Document: create, edit, delete, and filter
* Stored Procedure: create, edit, and delete
* Trigger: create, edit, and delete
* User-Defined Functions: create, edit, and delete
* Another scenario when user use partition key

### Open in Portal, Add to Quick Access, Search,  Refresh
1. Right-click a Cosmos DB account or a database, you can choose **Open in Portal** and manage the resource in browser on Azure portal.

     ![open in portal](./media/cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer-get-started/open-in-portal.png)

2. You can also add Cosmos DB account, Database, Collection to **Quick Access**.
3. **Search from Here** enables keywords search under the selected path.

### Database and Collection management

1. **Create Database**: Right-click the Cosmos DB account, choose **Create Database**, input the database name, **Enter** to complete.

    ![create database](./media/cosmosdb-in-storage-explorer-get-started/create-database.png) 
2. **Delete Database**: Right-click the database, click **Delete Database**, Click **Yes** on the pop-up window, the database node can be deleted and the Cosmos DB account refresh automatically.

3. **Create Collection**: Right-click your database, choose **Create Collection**, and then provide the following information like Collection ID, Storage capacity, etc. Click **OK** to finish. For partition key setting. refer to this link:  [Design for partitioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data#designing-for-partitioning).
If using partition key when create collection, once completing the creation, the partition key value can't be changed in documents, the Stored Procedure, Trigger, and UDF can't be changed once saved.

4. **Delete Collection**: Right-click the collection, click **Delete Collection**, Click **Yes** on the pop-up window, the collection node can be deleted and the database refresh automatically.
