### Analyze Azure Cosmos DB metrics

You can use Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer to analyze metrics for Azure Cosmos DB with metrics from other Azure services by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. For more information about how to use metrics explorer, see [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).

You can monitor server-side latency, request unit usage, and normalized request unit usage for your Azure Cosmos DB resources. You can select metrics specific to request units, storage, latency, availability, Cassandra, and others.

On the client side, you can collect the details for request charge, activity ID, exception and stack trace information, HTTP status and substatus code, and diagnostic string to debug issues that might occur. 

For more information and detailed instructions, see the following articles:

- [Monitor server-side latency](monitor-server-side-latency.md)
- [Monitor request unit usage](monitor-request-unit-usage.md)
- [Monitor normalized request unit usage](monitor-normalized-request-units.md)
- [Monitor key updates](monitor-account-key-updates.md)

For a list of all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor, see [Supported Azure Monitor metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported). For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Monitoring Azure Cosmos DB data reference metrics](monitor-reference.md#metrics).

### Monitor Azure Cosmos DB programmatically

The account level metrics available in the portal, such as account storage usage and total requests, aren't available by using the API for NoSQL. However, you can retrieve usage data at the collection level by using the API for NoSQL. To retrieve collection level data, use one of the following approaches:

- To use the REST API, [perform a GET on the collection](/rest/api/cosmos-db/get-a-collection). The quota and usage information for the collection is returned in the `x-ms-resource-quota` and `x-ms-resource-usage` headers in the response.

- To use the .NET SDK, use the [DocumentClient.ReadDocumentCollectionAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.readdocumentcollectionasync) method, which returns a [ResourceResponse](/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.resourceresponse-1) that contains many usage properties such as **CollectionSizeUsage**, **DatabaseUsage**, and **DocumentUsage**.

To access more metrics, use the [Azure Monitor SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Insights). Available metric definitions can be retrieved by using this format:

```http
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/{DocumentDBAccountName}/providers/microsoft.insights/metricDefinitions?api-version=2018-01-01
```

To retrieve individual metrics, use the following format:

```http
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/{DocumentDBAccountName}/providers/microsoft.insights/metrics?timespan={StartTime}/{EndTime}&interval={AggregationInterval}&metricnames={MetricName}&aggregation={AggregationType}&`$filter={Filter}&api-version=2018-01-01
```

To learn more, see [Azure monitoring REST API](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough).

### Analyze Azure Cosmos DB logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables. Each table has its own set of unique properties. All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema).

For the types of resource logs collected for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Azure Cosmos DB monitoring data reference](monitor-reference.md#resource-logs).

See the following articles for more information about working with Azure Monitor Logs for Azure Cosmos DB:

- [Monitor data by using Azure Diagnostic settings](monitor-resource-logs.md)
[Audit control plane logs](audit-control-plane-logs.md)
[Add a transformation for workspace data](tutorial-log-transformation.md)
[Use Micrometer client metrics for Java](client-metrics-java.md)

<!-- ### Sample Kusto queries. Required section. If you have sample Kusto queries for your service, add them after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]

Prior to using Log Analytics to issue Kusto queries, you must [enable diagnostic logs for control plane operations](audit-control-plane-logs.md#enable-diagnostic-logs-for-control-plane-operations). When you enable diagnostic logs, you select between storing your data in a [resource-specific tables](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) or single [AzureDiagnostics table (legacy)](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode). The exact text of Kusto queries depends on the [collection mode](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode) you selected when you enabled diagnostics logs.

Here are some queries that you can enter into the **Log search** search bar to help you monitor your Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

#### [Resource-specific table](#tab/resource-specific-diagnostics)

To query for all control-plane logs from Azure Cosmos DB:

```kusto
CDBControlPlaneRequests
```

To query for all data-plane logs from Azure Cosmos DB:

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
```

To query for a filtered list of data-plane logs, specific to a single resource:

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| where AccountName=="<account-name>"
```

To get a count of data-plane logs, grouped by resource:

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| summarize count() by AccountName
```

To generate a chart for data-plane logs, grouped by the type of operation:

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| summarize count() by OperationName
| render piechart
```

#### [AzureDiagnostics table (legacy)](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

To query for all control-plane logs from Azure Cosmos DB:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB"
| where Category=="ControlPlaneRequests"
```

To query for all data-plane logs from Azure Cosmos DB:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB"
| where Category=="DataPlaneRequests"
```

To query for a filtered list of data-plane logs, specific to a single resource:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB"
| where Category=="DataPlaneRequests"
| where Resource=="<account-name>"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the **AzureDiagnostics** table, many fields are case sensitive and uppercase including, but not limited to *ResourceId*, *ResourceGroup*, *ResourceProvider*, and *Resource*.

To get a count of data-plane logs, grouped by resource:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB"
| where Category=="DataPlaneRequests"
| summarize count() by Resource
```

To generate a chart for data-plane logs, grouped by the type of operation:

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB"
| where Category=="DataPlaneRequests"
| summarize count() by OperationName
| render columnchart
```

---

For Kusto queries you can use to troubleshoot issues with Azure Cosmos DB, see the following articles:

- [Troubleshoot issues by using basic queries](monitor-logs-basic-queries.md)
- [Troubleshoot issues by using advanced diagnostics queries](diagnostic-queries.md)

These examples are just a small sampling of the rich queries you can run in Azure Monitor by using the Kusto Query Language (KQL). For more examples, see [samples for Kusto queries](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/samples?pivots=azuremonitor).

### Azure Cosmos DB alert rules

The following table lists some common and recommended alert rules for Azure Cosmos DB.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Rate limiting on request units (metric alert) |Dimension name: *StatusCode*, Operator: *Equals*, Dimension values: 429  | Alerts if the container or a database has exceeded the provisioned throughput limit. |
|Region failed over |Operator: *Greater than*, Aggregation type: *Count*, Threshold value: 1 | When a single region is failed over. This alert is helpful if you didn't enable service-managed failover. |
|Rotate keys (activity log alert)| Event level: *Informational*, *Status*: started| Alerts when the account keys are rotated. You can update your application with the new keys. |

For more information and instructions on creating alerts for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Create alert on metrics](create-alerts.md). To create an alert to monitor if storage for a logical partition key is approaching 20 GB, see [Create alert on logical partition key size](how-to-alert-on-logical-partition-key-storage-size.md).
