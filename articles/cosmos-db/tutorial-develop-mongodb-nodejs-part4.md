# Create a MEAN.js app with Azure Cosmos DB - Part 4: Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure CLI

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. With Azure Cosmos DB, can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part tutorial demonstrates how to create a new [MongoDB](mongodb-introduction.md) API app written in Node.js with Express and Angular and then connect it to your Azure Cosmos DB database. Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the exact same code that you use for MongoDB apps. By using Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB, you benefit from the deployment, scaling, security, and super-fast reads and writes that Azure Cosmos DB provides as a managed service. 

Part 4 of the tutorial covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure resource group using the Azure CLI
> * Create an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Azure CLI

## Prerequisites

Before starting this part of the tutorial, ensure you've completed the steps in [Part 3](tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part3.md) of the tutorial. 

In this tutorial section, you can either use the Azure Cloud Shell (in your internet browser) or [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed locally. If you use the Azure CLI locally, ensure you running Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` at the command prompt to check your version. 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Log in to Azure

If you are using Azure CLI installed locally, log in to your Azure subscription with the [`az login`](/cli/azure/#login) command in a Windows Command Prompt or Mac Terminal window, and follow the on-screen directions. If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can skip this step.

```azurecli
az login 
``` 

After you're logged in, the command prompt displays all of your active subscriptions.

## Create a resource group

Now that you're logged in, create a [resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md) with a **unique name** by using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container in which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. 

If you are using Azure Cloud Shell, click **Try It**, follow the onscreen prompts to log in, then copy the following code into the command prompt.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create -n <my-resource-group> -l "East US"
```

* [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) creates a resource group.
* For `-n <my-resource-group>`, choose a unique name for your resource group. Substitute your own resource group name where you see the `<my-resource-group>` placeholder. 
* For `-l "East US"` you are selecting a location in which to create the resource group. You can choose any of the [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/). 

After the resource group is created, the command prompt displays the new resource group information.    

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

Create an Azure Cosmos DB account with the [`az cosmosdb create`](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#create) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az cosmosdb create --name <cosmosdb-name> --resource-group <my-resource-group> --kind MongoDB
```

* [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#create) creates a new Azure Cosmos DB account.
* For `--name <cosmosdb-name>`, substitute your own new unique Azure Cosmos DB account name where you see the `<my-cosmosdb-acct>` placeholder. This unique name is used as part of your Azure Cosmos DB endpoint (`https://<my-cosmosdb-acct>.documents.azure.com/`), so the name needs to be unique across all Azure Cosmos DB accounts in Azure.
* For `--myResourceGroup <my-resource-group>`, substitute the name of the resource group you just created. 
* For `--kind MongoDB`, this setting enables the Azure Cosmos DB account to have MongoDB client connections.

This tells Azure that in that resource group I created, go ahead and spin up an Azure Cosmos DB instance with a MongoDB database. It may take a minute or two for the command to complete. When it's done, the terminal window displays information about the new account. 

Once the terminal displays the confirmation information, you can now go see this new database in the Azure portal. Open a new browser window and go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), click the Azure Cosmos DB logo ![Azure Cosmos DB icon in the Azure portal](./media/tutorial-develop-mongodb-nodejs-part4/azure-cosmos-db-icon.png) on the left bar, and it shows you all the Azure Cosmos DB accounts you have.

Now click on the account and scroll down to view the map where the database is located.

Now scroll down on the left navigation and under **Settings**, click **Replicate data globally**. Now you can hover over the map and see what areas you can replicate into. For example, if you have numerous customers in Australia, you can click Australia Southeast or Australia East and replicate your data to Australia, or any of the other regions available. Replication is discussed in the last part of this tutorial, part 7, to be released soon. You can also learn more about global replication in [How to distribute data globally with Azure Cosmos DB](distribute-data-globally.md).
