# Troubleshoot common issues in Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-cassandra-api](includes/appliesto-cassandra-api.md)]

Cassandra API is a compatibility layer, which provides [wire protocol support](cassandra-support.md) for the popular open-source Apache Cassandra database, and is powered by [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction). As a fully managed cloud-native service, Azure Cosmos DB provides guarantees on availability, throughput, and consistency for Cassandra API, which are not possible in legacy implementations of Apache Cassandra. It also facilitates zero-maintenance platform operations, and zero-downtime patching. As such, many of its backend operations are different from Apache Cassandra, so we recommend particular settings and approaches to avoid common errors. 

The following article describes common errors and solutions for applications consuming Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API.

## Common errors and solutions

| Error               |  Description  | Solution  |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| OverloadedException     | The total number of request units consumed is more than the provisioned request-unit rate for the collection and has been throttled. | Consider scaling the throughput assigned to a keyspace or table from the Azure portal (see [here](manage-scale-cassandra.md) for scaling operations in Cassandra API) or you can implement a retry policy. For Java, see retry samples for [v3.x driver](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-cassandra-java-retry-sample) and [v4.x driver](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-cassandra-java-retry-sample-v4). See also [Azure Cosmos Cassandra Extensions for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-cassandra-extensions) |
| OverloadedException (even when sufficient throughput has been provisioned) | The system appears to be throttling requests despite sufficient throughput being provisioned for request volume and/or consumed Request Unit cost  | Cassandra API implements a system throughput budget for schema-level operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE). This budget should be enough for schema operations in a production system. However, if you have a high number of schema-level operations, it is possible you are exceeding this limit. As this budget is not user controlled, you will need to consider lowering the number of schema operations being run. If taking this action does not resolve the issue, or it is not feasible for your workload, please [create an Azure Support Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).|
| Intermittent Connectivity Errors (Java) | Connection drops or times out unexpectedly | The Apache Cassandra drivers for Java provide two native Reconnection Policies: ExponentialReconnectionPolicy and ConstantReconnectionPolicy. The default is ExponentialReconnectionPolicy. However, for Cosmos DB Cassandra API, we recommend ConstantReconnectionPolicy with a base delay of 2 seconds. See driver documentation [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.9/manual/core/reconnection/)  for Java v4.x driver, and [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.7/manual/reconnection/) for Java 3.x guidance (see also examples below).|

If your error is not listed above, and you are experiencing an error when executing a [supported operation in Cassandra API](cassandra-support.md), where the error is **not present when using native Apache Cassandra**, please [create an Azure Support Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request)

## Configuring ReconnectionPolicy for Java

### Version 3.x

For version 3.x of the Java driver, configuring Reconnection policy is done when creating a Cluster object:

```java
import com.datastax.driver.core.policies.ConstantReconnectionPolicy;

Cluster.builder()
  .withReconnectionPolicy(new ConstantReconnectionPolicy(2000))
  .build();
```

### Version 4.x

For version 4.x of the Java driver, configuring Reconnection policy is done by overriding settings in reference.conf:

```conf
datastax-java-driver {
  advanced {
    reconnection-policy{
      # The driver provides two implementations out of the box: ExponentialReconnectionPolicy and
      # ConstantReconnectionPolicy. We recommend ConstantReconnectionPolicy for Cassandra API, with 
      # base-delay of 2 seconds.
      class = ConstantReconnectionPolicy
      base-delay = 2 second
    }
}
```
