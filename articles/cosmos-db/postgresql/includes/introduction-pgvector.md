The `pgvector` extension adds an open-source vector similarity search to PostgreSQL.

This article introduces us to extra capabilities enabled by `pgvector`. It covers the concepts of vector similarity and embeddings, and provides guidance on how to enable the pgvector extension. We learn about, how to create, store and query the vectors.
