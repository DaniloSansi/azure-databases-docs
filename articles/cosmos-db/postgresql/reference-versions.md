# Supported database versions in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

## PostgreSQL versions

The version of PostgreSQL running in a cluster is
customizable during creation. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL currently supports the
following major [PostgreSQL
versions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/):

### PostgreSQL version 14

The current minor release is 14.4. Refer to the [PostgreSQL
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14-1.html) to
learn more about improvements and fixes in this minor release.

### PostgreSQL version 13

The current minor release is 13.7. Refer to the [PostgreSQL
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13-5.html) to
learn more about improvements and fixes in this minor release.

### PostgreSQL version 12

The current minor release is 12.11. Refer to the [PostgreSQL

The current minor release is 11.16. Refer to the [PostgreSQL

### PostgreSQL version 10 and older

We don't support PostgreSQL version 10 and older for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.

## Citus and other extension versions

Depending on which version of PostgreSQL is running in a cluster,
different [versions of PostgreSQL extensions](reference-extensions.md)
will be installed as well. In particular, PostgreSQL 14 comes with Citus 11, PostgreSQL versions 12 and 13 come with
Citus 10, and earlier PostgreSQL versions come with Citus 9.5.

## Next steps

* See which [extensions](reference-extensions.md) are installed in
  which versions.
* Learn to [create a cluster](quickstart-create-portal.md).
