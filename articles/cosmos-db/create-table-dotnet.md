# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a .NET application using the Table API

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, and create a table within that account using the Azure portal. You'll then write code to insert, update, and delete entities, and run some queries using the [Azure Cosmos DB Table API](https://aka.ms/premiumtablenuget) package from NuGet.
BUGBUG: We need to change the aka.ms URL to the right value.
## Prerequisites

If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

## Add a table

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table.md)]

## Add sample data

You can now add data to your new table using Data Explorer.

1. In Data Explorer, expand **sample-table**, click **Entities**, and then click **Add Entity**.
BUGBUG: ALL THE PICTURES HERE ARE WRONG, WE NEED TO UPDATE THEM FOR THE NEW PORTAL
   ![Create new entities in Data Explorer in the Azure portal](./media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-new-document.png)
2. Now add data to the PartitionKey value box and RowKey value box, and click **Add Entity**.

   ![Set the Partition Key and Row Key for a new entity](./media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-new-entity.png)
  
    You can now add more entities to your table, edit your entities, or query your data in Data Explorer. Data Explorer is also where you can scale your throughput and add stored procedures, user defined functions, and triggers to your table.

## Clone the sample application

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-table-clonerunsample](../../includes/cosmos-db-table-clonerunsample.md)]

## Review the code

Let's quickly review what's happening in the app. Open the Program.cs file and you'll find that these lines of code create the Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

* The CloudTableClient is initialized.

    ```csharp
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString); 
    CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();
    ```

* A new table is created if it does not exist.

    ```csharp
    CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference("people");
    table.CreateIfNotExists();
    ```

* A series of steps are executed on the table using the `TableOperation` class.

   ```csharp
   TableOperation insertOperation = TableOperation.Insert(item);
   table.Execute(insertOperation);
   ```
   
   ```csharp
   TableOperation retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve<T>(items[i].PartitionKey, items[i].RowKey);
   table.Execute(retrieveOperation);
   ```
   
   ```csharp
   TableOperation deleteOperation = TableOperation.Delete(items[i]);
   table.Execute(deleteOperation);
   ```

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-tutorial-review-slas](../../includes/cosmos-db-tutorial-review-slas.md)]

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps: 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a table using the Data Explorer, and run an app.  Now you can query your data using the Table API.
