# Create containers with large partition keys 

Azure Cosmos DB uses hash-based partitioning scheme to achieve horizontal scaling of data. The current version of the hash function computes hash based on the first 100 bytes of the partition key. If there are multiple partition keys that have the same first 100 bytes, then those logical partitions are considered effectively as the same logical partition by the service. This can lead to issues like partition size quota being incorrect, and unique indexes being applied across the partition keys. Large partition keys are introduced to solve this issue. Azure Cosmos DB now supports large partition keys with values up to 2 KB. 

Large partition keys are supported by using the functionality of an enhanced version of hash function, which can generate unique hash from larger partition keys. This hash version is also recommended for scenarios with high partition key cardinality irrespective of the size of the partition key. A Partition key cardinality is defined as the number of unique logical partitions, for example in the order of ~30000 logical partitions in a container. This article describes how to create a container with large partition key using Azure portal and different SDKs'. 

## Create a container with a large partition key 

### .Net SDK V2

When using the .Net SDK to create a container with large partition key, you should specify the "PartitionKeyDefinitionVersion.V2" property. The following example shows how to specify the Version property within the PartitionKeyDefinition object and set it to PartitionKeyDefinitionVersion.V2:

```csharp
DocumentCollection collection = await newClient.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(
database,
     new DocumentCollection
        {
           Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
           PartitionKey = new PartitionKeyDefinition
           {
             Paths = new Collection<string> {"/longpartitionkey" },
             Version = PartitionKeyDefinitionVersion.V2
           }
         },
      new RequestOptions { OfferThroughput = 400 });
```

### Azure portal 

When you create a container using Azure portal, checking the **My partition key is larger than 100-bytes** option will allow you to create a large partition key. By default, all the new containers are opted into using the large partition keys. Unselect the checkbox if you donâ€™t need large partition keys or if you have applications running on SDKs' version older than 1.18.
