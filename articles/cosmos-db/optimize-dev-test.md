# Optimizing for development and testing

Cosmos DB offers options for development and testing of the service for free.

## Cosmos DB Emulator (locally downloadable version)

[Cosmos DB emulator](local-emulator.md) is a local downloadable version of Cosmos DB that mimics the Cosmos DB cloud service. You can write and test code that uses the Cosmos DB APIs even if you have no network connection and without incurring any costs. You can write and test your code without any service charges. Cosmos DB emulator provides a local environment for development purposes with high fidelity to the Cosmos DB cloud service. You can develop and test your application locally, without creating an Azure subscription or incurring any costs, and when you're ready to deploy your application to the cloud, you simply instruct it to connect to the actual Cosmos DB endpoint in the cloud, and that’s it. No other modifications will be needed. You can also [set up a CI/CD pipeline with the Cosmos DB emulator](/tutorial-setup-ci-cd.md) build task in Azure DevOps to run tests. You can get started by visiting the [Cosmos DB emulator](local-emulator.md) documentation and downloading Cosmos DB emulator.
