# Get started with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB and Python
[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](../includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

This article shows you how to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB using the [PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) driver for Python. Once connected, you can perform operations on databases, collections, and docs.

> [!NOTE]
> The [example code snippets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started) are available on GitHub as a Python project.

In this quickstart, you'll communicate with the Azure Cosmos DBâ€™s API for MongoDB by using any of the open-source MongoDB client drivers for Python. Here, we'll use the [PyMongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/) driver. Also, you'll use the [MongoDB extension commands](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/custom-commands), designed to help you create and obtain database resources that are specific to the [Azure Cosmos DB capacity model](/azure/cosmos-db/account-databases-containers-items).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/)
* [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB resource](quickstart-python#create-a-database-account)

## Create a new Python app

### Create a new Python app

1. Create a new empty folder using your preferred terminal and follow the steps below.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you just want the finished code, download or fork and clone the [example code snippets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started) from GitHub that has the full example. You can also `git clone` the repo in Azure Cloud Shell to try out the code.
    
2. Change directory to the root of the project folder. Create a *requirements.txt* file with lines for the [PyMongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/) and the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) packages.

    ```text
    # requirements.txt
    pymongo
    python-dotenv
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install the packages.

#### [Windows](#tab/venv-windows)

```bash
# py -3 uses the global python interpreter. You can also use python3 -m venv .venv.
py -3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### [Linux / macOS](#tab/venv-linux+macos)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Connect with PyMongo driver to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB

To connect with the PyMongo native driver to Azure Cosmos DB, create an instance of the [``MongoClient``](TBD) class. This class is the starting point to perform all operations against databases. 

The most common constructor for **MongoClient** has two parameters:

| Parameter | Example value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``url`` | ``COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING`` environment variable | API for MongoDB connection string to use for all requests |
| ``options`` | `{ssl: true, tls: true, }` | [MongoDB Options](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html) for the connection. |

Refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](error-codes-solutions.md) for connection issues.
