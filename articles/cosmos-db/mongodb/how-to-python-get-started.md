# Get started with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB and Python
[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](../includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

This article shows you how to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB using the PyMongo driver package. Once connected, you can perform operations on databases, collections, and docs.

> [!NOTE]
> The [example code snippets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-python-getting-started) are available on GitHub as a Python project.

This article shows you how communicate with the Azure Cosmos DBâ€™s API for MongoDB by using one of the open-source MongoDB client drivers for Python, [PyMongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/). Also, you'll use the [MongoDB extension commands](/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/custom-commands), which are designed to help you create and obtain database resources that are specific to the [Azure Cosmos DB capacity model](/azure/cosmos-db/account-databases-containers-items).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/) or [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/)
* [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB resource](quickstart-python.md#create-an-azure-cosmos-db-account)

## Create a new Python app
