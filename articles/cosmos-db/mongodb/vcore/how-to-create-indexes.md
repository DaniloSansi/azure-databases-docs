# Indexing Best Practices in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB vCore](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb-vcore.md)]

## Queryable fields should always have indexes created
Read operations based on predicates and aggregates will first consult the index for the corresponding filters. In the absence of indexes, the database engine will perform a document scan to retrieve the matching documents. Scans will always be expensive and will get progressively more expensive as the volume of data in a collection continues to grow. For optimal queri performance, indexes should always be created for all queryable fields.

## Avoid unnecessary indexes and indexing all fields by default
While indexes should be created for all queryable fields, other fields within the document structure in a collection should not be indexed (either individually or through wildcard indexing) if they are not going to be part of query predicates or filters.

> [!TIP]
> Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore only indexes the _id field by default. All other fields are not indexed by default. The fields to be indexed should be planned ahead of time to maximize query performance while minimizing impact on write throughput from indexing too many fields.

When a new document is inserted for the first time or an existing document is updated or deleted, each of the specified fields in the index also needs to be updated. If the indexing policy contains a large number of fields (or all the fields in the document), additional resources will be consumed by the server in updating the corresponding indexes. When running at scale, only the queryable fields should be indexed while all other fields not used in query predicates should be excluded from the index. 

## Create the necessary indexes prior to data ingestion
For optimal performance, indexes should be created upfront before data is loaded. This ensures all documents that are inserted for the first time or subsequently updated or deleted will have the corresponding indexes updated synchronously as part of the write operation. If indexes are created after data has been ingested, additional server resources will be consumed to index historical data. Depending on the size of the historical data, this can be time consuming and could impact steady state read and write performance.

> [!NOTE]
For scenarios where indexes need to be added at a later time due to changes in read patterns, background indexing needs to be enabled on the cluster which can be done through a support ticket.

## For multiple indexes created on historical data, issue non-blocking createIndex commands for each field
It is not always possible to plan for all query patterns upfront, particularly as application requirements evolve. Changing business and application needs will inevitably require fields to be added to the index on a cluster with a large amount of historical data. 

In such scenarios, each createIndex command should be issued asynchronously without waiting on a response from the server.

> [!NOTE]
By default, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore responds to a createIndex operation only after the index has been fully built on the historical data. Depending on the size of the cluster and the volume of data already ingested, this can take time and may appear as though the server is not responding to the createIndex command. 

If the createIndex commands are being issued through the Mongo Shell, use Ctrl + C to interrupt the command to stop waiting on a response and issue the next set of operations. 

> [!NOTE]
Using Ctrl + C to interrupt the createIndex command after it has been issued does not terminate the index build operation on the server. It simply stops the Shell from waiting on a response from the server, while the server asynchronously continues to build the index over the existing documents.

## Create Compound Indexes for queries with predicates on multiple fields
Compound indexes should be used for the following scenarios:
- Queries with filters on multiple fields
- Queries with filters on multiple fields and with one or more fields sorted in ascending or descending order

Consider the following document within the 'cosmicworks' database and 'employee' collection
```json
{
    "firstName": "Steve",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "companyName": "Microsoft",
    "division": "Azure",
    "subDivision": "Data & AI",
    "timeInOrgInYears": 7
}
```

Consider the following query to find all employees with last name 'Smith' that have been with the organization for at least 5 years:
```javascript
db.employee.find({"lastName": "Smith", "timeInOrgInYears": {"$gt": 5}})
```

A compound index on both 'lastName' and 'timeInOrgInYears' will optimize this query:
```javascript
use cosmicworks;
db.employee.createIndex({"lastName" : 1, "timeInOrgInYears" : 1})
```

## Track the status of a createIndex operation
When indexes are added and historical data needs to be indexed, the progress of the index build operation(s) can be tracked using db.currentOp().

Consider the example below, to track the indexing progress on the 'cosmicworks' database.
```javascript
use cosmicworks;
db.currentOp()
```

When a createIndex operation is in progress, the response will look like:
```json
{
  "inprog": [
    {
      "shard": "defaultShard",
      "active": true,
      "type": "op",
      "opid": "30000451493:1719209762286363",
      "op_prefix": 30000451493,
      "currentOpTime": "2024-06-24T06:16:02.000Z",
      "secs_running": 0,
      "command": { "aggregate": "" },
      "op": "command",
      "waitingForLock": false
    },
    {
      "shard": "defaultShard",
      "active": true,
      "type": "op",
      "opid": "30000451876:1719209638351743",
      "op_prefix": 30000451876,
      "currentOpTime": "2024-06-24T06:13:58.000Z",
      "secs_running": 124,
      "command": { "createIndexes": "" },
      "op": "workerCommand",
      "waitingForLock": false,
      "progress": {},
      "msg": ""
    }
  ],
  "ok": 1
}
```

## Enable Large Index Keys by default
Even if the documents do not contain keys that have a large number of characters or the documents do not contain multiple levels of nesting, specifying large index keys ensures these scenarios are covered.

Consider the example below to enable large index keys on the 'large_index_coll' collection within the 'cosmicworks' database.

```javascript
use cosmicworks;
db.runCommand(
{
 "createIndexes": "large_index_coll",
 "indexes": [
    {
        "key": { "ikey": 1 },
        "name": "ikey_1",
        "enableLargeIndexKeys": true
    }
    ]
})
```

## Prioritizing Index Builds over new Write Operations using the Blocking Option
For scenarios in which the index should strictly be created before data has been loaded and for new writes to be blocked until historical data has been fully indexed, the blocking option should be specified when creating the index.

Setting `{ "blocking": true }` blocks all write operations (delete, update, insert) to the collection until index creation is completed. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios such as migration utilities where indexes are created on empty collections before data writes commence.

Consider an example of the blocking option for index creation being specified on the 'employee' collection within the 'cosmicworks' database:

```javascript
use cosmicworks;
db.runCommand({
  createIndexes: "employee",
  indexes: [{"key":{"name":1}, "name":"name_1"}],
  blocking: true
})

```
