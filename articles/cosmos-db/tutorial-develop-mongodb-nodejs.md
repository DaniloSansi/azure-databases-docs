# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a MEAN.js app 

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. With Azure Cosmos DB, can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases that benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This multi-part tutorial demonstrates how to create a new [MongoDB](mongodb-introduction.md) API app with Express, Angular, and Node.js (MEAN.js), and then connect it to your Azure Cosmos DB database. Azure Cosmos DB supports MongoDB client connections, so you can use Azure Cosmos DB in place of MongoDB, but use the exact same code that you use for MongoDB apps. By using Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB, you benefit from the deployment, scaling, security, and super-fast reads and writes that Azure Cosmos DB provides as a managed service. 

This multi-part tutorial covers the following tasks:
