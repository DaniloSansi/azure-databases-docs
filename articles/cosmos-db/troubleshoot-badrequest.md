# Diagnose and troubleshoot bad request exceptions in Azure Cosmos DB
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

The HTTP status code 400 represents the request contains invalid data or it's missing required parameters.

## <a name="missing-id-property"></a>Missing the ID property
On this scenario, it's common to see the error:

```
The input content is invalid because the required properties - 'id; ' - are missing
```

### Solution
This error means the JSON document that is being sent to the service is lacking the required ID property. Specify an ID property with a string value as per the [REST specification](/rest/api/cosmos-db/documents), the SDKs do not autogenerate values for this property.

## <a name="invalid-partition-key-type"></a>Invalid partition key type
On this scenario, it's common to see errors like:

```
Partition key ... is invalid.
```

### Solution
This error means the value provided as partition key is invalid. The value of the partition key should be a string or a number.

## <a name="wrong-partition-key-value"></a>Wrong partition key value
On this scenario, it's common to see the error:

```
PartitionKey extracted from document doesnâ€™t match the one specified in the header
```

### Solution
This error means you are executing an operation and passing a partition key value that does not match the document's body value for the expected property. If the collection's partition key path is `/myPartitionKey`, the document has a property called `myPartitionKey` with a value that does not match what was provided as partition key value when calling the SDK method. Make sure to correct it and execute the request.
