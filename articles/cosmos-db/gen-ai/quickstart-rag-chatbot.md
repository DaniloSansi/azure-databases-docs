# Quickstart - Build a RAG chatbot with Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL API

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

In this quickstart, we demonstrate how to build a [RAG Pattern](../gen-ai/rag.md) application using a subset of the Movie Lens dataset. This sample uses the Python SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL to perform vector search for RAG, store and retrieve chat history, and store the vectors of the chat history to use as a semantic cache. Azure OpenAI is used to generate embeddings and Large Language Model (LLM) completions.

At the end, we create a simple UX using Gradio to allow users to type in questions and display responses generated by Azure OpenAI or served from the cache. The responses also display an elapsed time so you can see the impact caching has on performance versus generating a response.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the Python notebook for this quickstart [here](https://aka.ms/CosmosPythonRAGQuickstart).
> For more RAG samples, visit: [AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureDataRetrievalAugmentedGenerationSamples)

**Important Note**: This sample requires you to setup accounts for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, and Azure OpenAI. To get started, visit:
- [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL Python Quickstart](../nosql/quickstart-python.md)
- [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL Vector Search](../nosql/vector-search.md)
- [Azure OpenAI](../../ai-services/openai/toc.yml)
