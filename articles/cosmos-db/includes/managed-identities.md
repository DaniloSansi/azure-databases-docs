Managed identities are one of many types of identity resources in Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when connecting to services that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Managed identities can be used in lieu of traditional resource-owned credentials like keys. In Azure Cosmos DB, managed identities provide a way for your applications to obtain a Microsoft Entra token to authenticate to Azure Cosmos DB without you needing to write a large amount of authentication code. For more information, see [managed identities for Azure resources](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
