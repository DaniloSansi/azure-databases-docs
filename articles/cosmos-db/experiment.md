# Azure Cosmos DB documentation experiment

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally-distributed, multi-model database. Because you can do so much with Azure Cosmos DB - from creating a graph to creating a document database, or migrating your data from MongoDB, Cassandra, or Azure Table storage - organizing the documentation can be a challenge. So we'd like your help.

We are testing the organization of the table of contents (on the left) and the [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) and we'd like to get your feedback on these proposed changes. 

**Original page and table of contents**

**Experimental page and table of contents**

To open the the different views, open a new incognito window in Google Chrome by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+N in Google Chrome, and then navigate to the [landing page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/). Use the images above to determine which version you see, original or experimental. Open an additional incognito window and open the landing page again, and see if you can get the other view. You may need to try a few times to get both versions in separate windows. 

Click the **Provide feedback** button below and provide feedback on the original and experimental experience after you've had a chance to get familiar with the new organization. Please submit the form no later than midnight March 30th, 2018 so that the feedback can be reviewed and incorporated.
