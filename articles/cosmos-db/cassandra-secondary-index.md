# Secondary indexing in Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API

The Cassandra API in Azure Cosmos DB leverages the underlying Indexing infrastructure to expose the indexing strength that is inherent in the platform. Cassandra API in Azure Cosmos DB supports secondary indexing to create an index on certain attributes. In general, it's not advised to use Apache Cassandra to execute filter queries on the columns that aren't partitioned. You must use ALLOW FILTERING syntax explicitly which, results in a less performant operation. However, in Azure CosmosDB you can run such queries on low cardinality attributes because they fan out across partitions to retrieve the results.

It's not advised to create an index on a frequently updated column. It is prudent to create an index when you define the table. This ensures that data and indexes are in a consistent state. In case you create a new index on the existing data, currently, you can't track the index progress change for the table. If you need to track the progress for this operation, you have to request the progress change via a [support ticket]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

If you are trying to create a new index on existing data, tracking the index progress change for a table is not exposed. If you need to track the progress - please request the progress change via a support ticket.

## Indexing example

First, create a sample keyspace and table by running the following commands on the CQL shell prompt:

```shell
CREATE KEYSPACE sampleks WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'SimpleStrategy'};
CREATE TABLE sampleks.t1(user_id int PRIMARY KEY, lastname text) WITH cosmosdb_provisioned_throughput=400;
``` 

Then, insert sample user data with the following commands:

```shell
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (1, 'nishu');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (2, 'vinod');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (3, 'bat');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (5, 'vivek');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (6, 'siddhesh');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (7, 'akash');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (8, 'Theo');
insert into sampleks.t1(user_id,lastname) values (9, 'jagan');
```

If you try executing the following statement, you will run into an error that asks you to use `ALLOW FILTERING`: 

```
select user_id, lastname from sampleks.t1 where lastname='nishu';
``` 

Although the Cassandra API supports ALLOW FILTERING as mentioned in the previous section, however, it's not recommended. You should instead create an index in the as shown in the following example:

```shell
CREATE INDEX ON sampleks.t1 (lastname);
```
After creating an index on the "lastname" field, you can now run the previous query successfully. With Cassandra API in Azure Cosmos DB, you do not have to provide an index name. A default index with format `tablename_columnname_idx` is used. For example, ` t1_lastname_idx` is the index name for the previous table.

## Dropping the index 
You need to know the index name is to drop the index. Run the `desc schema` command to get the description of your table. The output of this command includes the index name in the format `CREATE INDEX tablename_columnname_idx ON keyspacename.tablename(columnname)'. You can then use the index name to drop the index as shown in the following example:

```
CREATE INDEX tablename_columnname_idx ON keyspacename.tablename(columnname)
```

Use the index name to drop the index as below;

```shell
drop index sampleks.t1_lastname_idx;
```

### Note 
Secondary index in not supported on:
 - Data types like frozen collection types, decimal and variant types.
 - Static 
 - Clustering keys
