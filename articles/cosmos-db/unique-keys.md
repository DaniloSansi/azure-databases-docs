# Unique keys in Azure Cosmos DB

Unique keys provide developers with the ability to add a layer of data integrity to their database. By creating a unique key policu when a container is created, you ensure the uniqueness of one or more values per [partition](partition-data.md). Once a container has been created with a unique key policy, it prevents the creation of any new or updated items with values that duplicate those specified by the unique key constraint.   

As an example, let's look at how a user database associated with a [social application](use-cases.md#web-and-mobile-applications) could benefit from having a unique key policy on email addresses. By making the user's email address a unique key, you ensure each record has a unique email address, and no new records can be created with duplicate email addresses. 

If you did want users to be able to create multiple records with the same email address, but not the same first name, last name, and email address, you could add other paths to the unique key policy. So instead of creating a unique key simply based on an email address, you can create a unique key that's a combination of the first name, last name, and email. In this case each unique combination of the three paths is allowed, so the database could contain items that have the following path values. Each of these records would pass the unique key policy.  

**Allowed values for unique key of firstName, lastName, and email**

|First name|Last name|Email address|
|---|---|---|
|Gaby|Duperre|gaby@contoso.com |
|Gaby|Duperre|gaby@fabrikam.com|
|Ivan|Duperre|gaby@fabrikam.com|
|    |Duperre|gaby@fabrikam.com|
|    |       |gaby@fabraikam.com|

If you attempted to insert another record with any of the combinations listed in the table above, you would receive an error indicating that the unique key constraint was not met. 

> [!NOTE]
> Unique keys are supported by the lastest versions of the [.NET](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md) and [.NET Core](documentdb-sdk-dotnet-core.md) DocumentDB (SQL) SDKs, and the [Mongo DB API](mongodb-feature-support.md#unique-indexes). The Table API and Graph API do not support unique keys at this time.

## Using unique keys

Unique keys must be defined when the container is created, and the unique key is scoped to the partition key. To build on the example above, if you partition based on zip code, you could have the records from the table above in each partition. 

A maximum of 16 path values (for example /firstName, /lastName, etc.) can be included in each unique key. 

Each unique key policy can have a maximum of 10 unique key constraints or combinations. So the example provided above using first name, last name, and email address is just one constraint, and it uses three of the 16 possible paths available. 

Once a container is created with a unique key definition, it cannot be changed unless you recreate the collection. If you have existing data that you'd like to implement unique keys on, create the new container, and then use the appropriate data migration tool to move the data to the new container. For DocumentDB (SQL) collections, use the [Data Migration Tool](import-data.md). For MongoDB collections, use [mongoimport.exe or mongorestore.exe](mongodb-migrate.md).

Unique key constraints do add to the request unit charge associated with creating or updating an item. 

## Create a collection with a unique key policy 

The following code sample shows how to create a new DocumentDB (SQL) collection with two unique key constraints. The first constraint is the firstName, lastName, email constraint described in the example above. The second constraint is the users address. 

```csharp
private static async Task CreateCollectionIfNotExistsAsync(string dataBase, string collection)
       {
           try
           {
               await client.ReadDocumentCollectionAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(dataBase, collection));
           }
           catch (DocumentClientException e)
           {
               if (e.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
               {
                   DocumentCollection myCollection = new DocumentCollection();
                   myCollection.Id = collection;
                   myCollection.PartitionKey.Paths.Add("/pk");
                   myCollection.UniqueKeyPolicy  = new UniqueKeyPolicy
                   {
                       UniqueKeys =
                       new Collection<UniqueKey> { new UniqueKey { Paths = new Collection<string> { "/firstName" , "/lastName" , "/email" }}
                                                   new UniqueKey { Paths = new Collection<string> { "/address" } },
                                                   
                       }
                  };
                   await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(
                       UriFactory.CreateDatabaseUri(dataBase),
                       myCollection,
                       new RequestOptions { OfferThroughput = 2500 });
              }
               else
               {
                   throw;
               }
           }
```

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create unique keys for items in a database. If you are creating a container for the first time, review [Partitioning data in Azure Cosmos DB](partition-data.md) as unique keys and partition keys rely on each other.
