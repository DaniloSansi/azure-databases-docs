# Perform Azure Cosmos DB Table storage operations with Azure PowerShell 

>[!NOTE]
> Azure Cosmos DB Table API is a premium offering for storage tables. In most cases, the commands in this article will work against both standard Azure Storage tables and Cosmos DB premium tables, but this article is specific to Cosmos DB premium tables. If you are using standard Azure Storage tables rather than Cosmos DB premium tables, please see [Azure Table Storage with PowerShell](table-storage-how-to-use-powershell.md).

<!--Mimi -- is the following still valid? -->
The Cosmos DB Table API enables you to store and query huge sets of structured, non-relational data. The main components of the service are tables, entities, and properties. A table is a collection of entities. An entity is a set of properties. Each entity can have up to 252 properties, which are all name-value pairs. This article assumes that you are already familiar with the Azure Table Storage Service concepts. For detailed information, see [Understanding the Table Service Data Model](/rest/api/storageservices/Understanding-the-Table-Service-Data-Model) and [Get started with Azure Table storage using .NET](table-storage-how-to-use-dotnet.md).

This how-to article covers common table storage operations. You learn how to:

> * Create a table
> * Retrieve a table
> * Add table entities
> * Query a table
> * Delete table entities

The examples require Azure PowerShell module version 4.4.0 or later. In a PowerShell window, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If nothing is listed, or you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps). 

## Preparation

Cosmos DB Table API is in preview, so you have to install the assemblies locally in order to use these PowerShell cmdlets. For instructions on how to do that, see [Azure RM Storage Tables PowerShell module for Cosmos DB Tables](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/paulomarques/2017/05/23/azure-rm-storage-tables-powershell-module-now-includes-support-for-cosmos-db-tables/).

To perform these exercises, you need a Cosmos DB database account. If you don't already have one, create a new Cosmos DB account using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For help creating a new database account, see [Azure Cosmos DB: Create a database account](create-table-dotnet#create-a-database-account).

Get the database account name and resource group from the portal; you need these in your script to access the tables. 

## Sign in to Azure

Log in to your Azure subscription with the `Login-AzureRmAccount` command and follow the on-screen directions.

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

## Create a table or reference a table

You use the same command to get a reference to a table and to create a table. 
To create a table or to get a reference to a table, use **Get-AzureStorageTableTable**. If you call this with the name of a table that doesn't exist, it will create a new table with that name and return a reference to the new table. If the table does exist, it returns a reference to that table.

```powershell
# set the name of the resource group in which your Cosmos DB Account resides.
$resourceGroup = "contosocosmosrg"
# if you want to make sure the resource group is valid, try this command
Get-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup

# set the Cosmos DB account name 
$cosmosDBAccountName = "contosocosmostbl" 

# set the table name 
$tableName = "contosotable1"

# Get a reference to a table. This will create the table if it doesn't exist.
$storageTable = Get-AzureStorageTableTable `
  -resourceGroup $resourceGroup `
  -tableName $tableName `
  -cosmosDbAccount $cosmosDBAccountName 
```

You can't list the tables in the Cosmos DB Account using PowerShell, but you can log into the portal and see the table. Now let's look at how to manage the entities in the table.

[!INCLUDE [storage-table-entities-powershell-include](../../includes/storage-table-entities-powershell-include.md)]

## Delete a table 

PowerShell doesn't support deleting tables from Cosmos DB. To delete a table, go to the [Azure portal](https://azure.portal.com), locate the Azure Cosmos DB Account you're using, then delete the table. 

## Clean up resources

If you created a new resource group and created a new Cosmos DB Account in that group, you can remove all of the assets you have created in this exercise by removing the resource group. This command deletes all resources contained within the group as well as the resource group itself.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup
```
