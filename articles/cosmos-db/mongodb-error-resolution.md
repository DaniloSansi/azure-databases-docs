# Common errors and how to resolve them

Azure Cosmos DB implements the wire protocols of common NoSQL databases, including MongoDB. By providing a native implementation of the wire protocols directly and efficiently inside Cosmos DB, it allows existing client SDKs, drivers, and tools of the NoSQL databases to interact with Cosmos DB transparently. Cosmos DB does not use any source code of the databases for providing wire-compatible APIs for any of the NoSQL databases. Any MongoDB client driver that understands the wire protocol versions should be able to natively connect to Cosmos DB. 

While Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB is compatible with version 3.2 of the MongoDB's wire protocol (and features or query operators added in version 3.4 of the wire protocol are currently available as a preview feature), there are some custom error codes that apply to point users to Cosmos DB specific errors. These, along with their respective solutions are discussed below.

## Common errors and solutions

| Error               | Code  | Description  | Solution  |
|---------------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| TooManyRequests     | 16500 | The total number of request units consumed is more than the provisioned request-unit rate for the collection and has been throttled. | Consider scaling the throughput  assigned to a container or a set of containers from the Azure portal or retrying again. |
| ExceededMemoryLimit | 16501 | As a multi-tenant service, the operation has gone over the client's memory allotment. | Reduce the scope of the operation through more restrictive query criteria or contact support from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). <br><br>Example: <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;db.getCollection('users').aggregate([<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{$match: {name: "Andy"}}, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{$sort: {age: -1}}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;])</em>) |
| MongoDB wire version issues | - | The older versions of Mongo drivers are unable to detect the Cosmos DB account name in the connection strings. | Append *appName=@accountName@* at the end of your Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB connection string, where *accountName* is your Cosmos DB account name. |
