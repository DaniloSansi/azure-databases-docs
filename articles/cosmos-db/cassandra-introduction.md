# Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB: Cassandra API

[Azure Cosmos DB](introduction.md) provides the Cassandra API (preview) for applications that are written for Apache Cassandra that need premium capabilities like:

* [Scalable storage size and throughput](partition-data.md).
* Single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile.
* Guaranteed high availability.

Cassandra applications can migrate to Azure Cosmos DB by using the Cassandra API with no code changes, you simply update your connection string, and go! The Cassandra API enables you to interact with data stored in Azure Cosmos DB using the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and Cassandra client drivers you’re already familiar with.
