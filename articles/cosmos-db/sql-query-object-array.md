A key feature of the SQL API is array and object creation. The previous example created a new JSON object, `AreFromSameCityState`. You can also construct arrays, as shown in the following example:


```sql
    SELECT [f.address.city, f.address.state] AS CityState
    FROM Families f
```

The results are:

```json
    [
      {
        "CityState": [
          "Seattle",
          "WA"
        ]
      },
      {
        "CityState": [
          "NY", 
          "NY"
        ]
      }
    ]
```

The following SQL query is another example of using array within in subqueries. This query gets all the distinct  given names of children in an arrary.

```sql
SELECT f.id, ARRAY(SELECT DISTINCT VALUE c.givenName FROM c IN f.children) as ChildNames
FROM f
```
