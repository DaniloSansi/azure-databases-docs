This article explains how to find the request unit charge for operations executed against Azure Cosmos DB's Gremlin API.

Headers returned by the Gremlin API are mapped to custom status attributes which are currently surfaced by the Gremlin .NET and Java SDK. The request charge is available under the `x-ms-request-charge` key.

# Finding the request unit charge from the Gremlin.NET SDK

```csharp
ResultSet<dynamic> results = client.SubmitAsync<dynamic>("g.V().count()").Result;
double requestCharge = (double)results.StatusAttributes["x-ms-request-charge"];
```

# Finding the request unit charge from the Gremlin Java SDK

```java
ResultSet results = client.submit("g.V().count()");
Double requestCharge = (Double)results.statusAttributes().get().get("x-ms-request-charge");
```
