# Index paths in Azure Cosmos DB

Index paths start with the root (`/`) and typically end with the `?` wildcard operator. This pattern denotes that there are multiple possible values for the prefix. For example, to serve SELECT * FROM Families F WHERE F.familyName = "Andersen", you must include an index path for `/familyName/?` in the containerâ€™s index policy.

Index paths can also use the `*` wildcard operator to specify the behavior for paths recursively under the prefix. For example, `/payload/*` can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.

Here are the common patterns for specifying index paths:

When you set custom index paths, you're required to specify the default indexing rule for the entire item, denoted by the special path `/*`.
